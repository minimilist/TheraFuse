I mean, we could go back and talk about your relationships, your past relationships. ; Therapist: We've often learned that it's a very bad idea to be vulnerable. ; Therapist: But we're talking about that you guys are also in a cultural context where that's not encouraged to be vulnerable like that. ; Patient: And to some degree, we have been vulnerable because of cultural context. ; Therapist: Yes, you have. ; Therapist: Well, you've been together for a long time, and so you're... Is that what you mean? ; Patient: No, I mean being gay. ; Therapist: That's what I mean. ; Patient: Being vulnerable. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're even more vulnerable gay. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: There's a vulnerability about being gay, period. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: So there's an even... You need to protect, yeah? ; Therapist: I validate and normalize their need to protect themselves as individuals and gay men in a heterosexual world.",

; Patient: Well, I've been having a lot of anxiety lately. ; Therapist: Anxiety? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Just getting really nervous in the morning when it's time to go to work. ; Patient: Just like butterflies in my stomach kind of pounding hard. ; Therapist: So you're anxious when you're getting ready to go to work? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you know what might be causing that? ; Patient: Well, I noticed it a little while ago when I went to get in my car to go to work in the morning. ; Patient: I was putting some stuff in the trunk and I saw some damage that had happened to the car from a previous car accident. ; Patient: And just out of nowhere I started feeling nervous about driving to work. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you went out to your car, you saw some damage, it reminded you of an accident? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I was in an accident at the end of last year. ; Patient: I didn't get hurt. ; Patient: There was no real damage to the car that I noticed. ; Patient: I just went on about my business. ; Patient: I didn't have any issues after the accident. ; Patient: And now all of a sudden I'm thinking about this car accident again. ; Patient: And I don't know where that's coming from. ; Therapist: And you said the accident occurred at the end of last year? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I can't really remember exactly when, but it was cold out when it happened. ; Therapist: So maybe about eight months ago. ; Therapist: Does that sound right? ; Patient: Yeah, around Halloween or so. ; Therapist: When did the symptoms start, being anxious when you're getting ready to go to work? ; Patient: I would say at least a month ago, maybe six weeks. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And you've been having those continuously from then? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Every morning I get up, I'm just really nervous about going to work. ; Patient: And I come out to get in the car and sometimes I can barely get in, just thinking about being in a car accident again. ; Therapist: Have you ever been late to work because of the anxiety? ; Patient: I'm late almost every day. ; Therapist: Almost every day? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So this has been a problem for you in a few different ways. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I even called out a couple times because I was just paralyzed. ; Therapist: Have you tried anything to reduce the anxiety, like using another car or anything else? ; Patient: Well, yeah. ; Patient: I live in a house with multiple cars, so I tried driving my mom's car to work one day. ; Patient: And I had the same feelings. ; Patient: And initially I thought it was just my car because I did notice some damage to the back of the car. ; Patient: I was hit in the back. ; Patient: And I was going through the trunk one day and I saw that the car was actually pushed in. ; Patient: I didn't think there was any real damage. ; Patient: Then I noticed damage to the back of the car and I was like, wow, I could have been seriously hurt in this accident. ; Patient: And that's when I started having these feelings. ; Patient: I just started thinking about how bad the accident could have been. ; Patient: So you ask if I tried to do anything different. ; Patient: I tried driving my mom's car. ; Patient: I tried driving my dad's car. ; Patient: But it seems to be just driving any car. ; Patient: I'm having all of this anxiety. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And you're having kind of physical distress too. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Like you're feeling it physically? ; Patient: Overwhelmed. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I'm feeling a lot of swelling in my chest. ; Patient: Like really panicky. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you ever have any dreams about the accident or anything related to the accident? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: Do you ever have any point when you're not asleep where you feel like you're kind of taken back to the time the accident happened? ; Therapist: Like you're reliving it in any way? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Do you remember the accident? ; Patient: Yeah, I remember it pretty well. ; Patient: I was waiting at a stop sign and I think the person behind me, they must not have been paying attention, but they rear-ended me. ; Therapist: Who do you believe is responsible for the accident? ; Patient: Nobody really. ; Patient: I mean, it was an accident. ; Patient: There was no real damage. ; Patient: Accidents happen all the time. ; Patient: It's just a fender bender. ; Therapist: So from the time that you noticed these anxiety symptoms, have you had periods where you were happy and had kind of positive emotional experiences? ; Patient: I've been really down since I started having these symptoms. ; Therapist: Have you been down the whole time? ; Therapist: Have there been moments where you haven't been or has it been consistently down? ; Patient: I would say more down. ; Therapist: More down, but sometimes up? ; Patient: I can't really remember any times. ; Patient: Not sure. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about your relationships with other people? ; Therapist: Have they changed from when the anxiety started? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: Do you feel detached from people? ; Patient: Detached? ; Patient: You mean like separated, like not wanting to be around? ; Patient: Not connecting with people? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: Nothing like that. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How about any feelings of irritability or anger outbursts or anything like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Do you feel like you've been behaving in a more reckless way at all? ; Patient: What do you mean by reckless? ; Therapist: Like taking more chances in relationships or another, nothing like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You're aware of like when something surprises us, we kind of have this startle response, like we jump, it's natural. ; Therapist: Have you noticed that response has changed at all? ; Patient: Yeah, I have been a little on edge. ; Patient: Things have been like scaring me, the phone ringing, people knocking at the door, dogs barking. ; Patient: It's kind of had me on edge a little bit. ; Therapist: And you feel like your response is more than it used to be, more than just the natural startle response you had? ; Patient: Yeah, that's kind of worrying me a little bit too. ; Therapist: That's worrying you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any trouble concentrating? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: You've been okay concentrating? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Staying focused has been... ; Patient: Yeah, I'm good in that area. ; Therapist: How about trouble with sleep? ; Therapist: Trouble falling asleep, staying asleep? ; Patient: No trouble falling asleep, but I have had trouble staying asleep. ; Patient: I've been waking up pretty much around the clock throughout the night. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you're getting to sleep okay, you're falling asleep okay, but just having trouble staying asleep. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Are you thinking of anything specific when you wake up? ; Patient: Not really, just maybe like thinking about going to work in the morning and... ; Patient: But no, nothing major. ; Therapist: Any use of drugs or alcohol? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How about medical problems? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing? ; Therapist: Are there ever points from when this anxiety started that you feel kind of outside of your own body, kind of an unreal feeling where you're separated from your own body? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: How about times when you feel disconnected from the environment, like an unreal feeling about what's going on around you? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: All right, Jessica, I'm going to get you in to see a counselor here if you're open to that, if that's something you want to do. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And I appreciate you taking the time to tell me what's going on and answer these questions. ; Therapist: It's been helpful. ; Patient: Thank you for seeing me. ; Therapist: Sure.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: So this is a Breaking Bad News consultation. ; Therapist: It's a case of a 47 year old man who has been seen by one of my colleagues who had an ultrasound scan requested for some right upper quadrant pain. ; Therapist: And the scan was reported as saying that there was a potential mass in the head of the pancreas so the ultrasound department requested an urgent CT and I'm on call and the facts have just come through to me suggesting that there is a mass in the head of the pancreas and some potential liver metastases. ; Therapist: I have waited until the end of my morning surgery, booked a double appointment and let the girls know not to disturb me now that I'm not on call, and have rung the patient up and asked him to come in, told him that there's something on the scan that we need to discuss, offered for him to bring somebody with him and give him a bit of a warning shot and he's just arrived. ; Therapist: Come in. ; Therapist: Hi! ; Patient: Hi there Doc. ; Therapist: Have a seat. ; Therapist: So we just spoke on the phone didn't we? ; Therapist: My name is Dr. Evers. ; Patient: Right yes. ; Therapist: I know you've previously been seeing my colleague haven't you? ; Patient: Yes, yes I saw Dr O'Donovan and he did that scan for gallstones. ; Therapist: Okay. So, what happened from there then? ; Therapist: Just tell me a little bit about what's happened so that I'm up to speed. ; Patient: I went for that scan and then I was a bit surprised actually. ; Patient: They actually rang me up a few days afterwards and said that I needed another scan to check things out. ; Patient: So I was there, it was on Monday this week, when I went and they put me through that doughnutty thing and then you gave me room. ; Therapist: Okay. So, in between the scan happening and the second scan happening, was it the department that had rung you or had you spoken to Dr O'Donovan about it? ; Patient: No, no it was a nice old sound girl who rang me saying they were booking this appointment for this extra scan. ; Therapist: And did they give you any idea why they needed to do an extra one? ; Patient: No they didn't actually, I mean I tried to ask you always do, and like sweet talk a lady but she was not for telling. ; Therapist: Okay and had you had any thoughts yourself or any worries about why they were calling you back? ; Patient: I guessed it was something in the gallstones. ; Therapist: So just tell me a little bit about what symptoms you've been having then, but we do have your scan result here today and there is something we need to discuss on it. ; Therapist: I'd just like to make sure that I know what's been happening to you first of all and then we'll go into the detail. ; Patient: It all started a few months ago really with this tummy pain and then I saw your colleague and he said we'd better get his scan. ; Patient: So I went for that scan, it was only about two weeks ago and then I got literally four or five days later got the phone call that I needed this additional scan so I went on Monday and had that done. ; Therapist: Okay, and so do you still have pain at the minute? ; Patient: Yes, yeah I mean it's just there all the time. ; Therapist: Okay, well as I said your scan result has come through to me today and I'm afraid there is something that's potentially a little bit worrying on it. ; Patient: Really? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I didn't expect that. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: So what's the worrying thing that you found? ; Therapist: Well, if I take you back to the first scan, first of all, so what it appears that that showed is that there was something suspicious on what we call the pancreas gland. ; Patient: Suspicious? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So there is a gland at the top of your abdomen here which is quite close to your gallbladder and called the pancreas. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And when they did the ultrasound scan which is a good scan but isn't particularly detailed. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: There was something on it that they saw that they wanted a little bit more information ; Therapist: about. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So that's why they called you back for the second scan. ; Patient: Doesn't sound good, does it? ; Therapist: That was a CT scan which is a detailed one so that we could see what it is that we're likely to be talking about. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So this second scan has shown that there definitely is something on your pancreas gland. ; Patient: Really? ; Therapist: And when I say something, what we need to worry about is whether or not this could be a type of cancer. ; Patient: God. ; Patient: I didn't expect that. ; Patient: God. ; Patient: I'm only 47. ; Patient: Cancer. ; Therapist: And I'm really sorry to have to break it to you like this but I felt that it was important that as soon as I knew that I communicated that to you and that you knew what we were thinking as well. ; Patient: God. ; Therapist: So I mean I know that I've just dropped a big bombshell on you. ; Patient: Oh yes, God. ; Therapist: Have you got any questions at the minute? ; Therapist: Have you got anything that you've... ; Patient: Erm, what's the pancreas and if I have got cancer, what can they, can they cut it out? ; Therapist: Erm, it depends. ; Therapist: Basically your pancreas is a gland that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen as I said and it controls some of the sort of the hormones, the fluids that your body makes. ; Therapist: Erm, because it's at the back of the abdomen, often we don't know very much about it until it starts causing a bit of a problem like your pain that you've been getting. ; Therapist: So that probably explains why you've not had many other symptoms as well. ; Patient: Right, right. ; Therapist: Erm, the answer is I don't know what could be done about it but we need to ask a specialist what could be done about it. ; Therapist: What we usually do in this situation is ask a specialist to see your scan and I'll let them know today. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: To have a look at your scan and to see you and to have a think about what this could be. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely is. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then from that what we do about it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I understand that I've just thrown a whole lot of information at you and that a lot of it is very worrying information. ; Patient: Oh yeah, God, I just hadn't expected that at all. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Erm, I mean is there anybody that you could, that you could bring in with you and we could have another bit of a chat maybe tomorrow when you've had a bit more time? ; Patient: I suppose I could, I'll ask my mum because I hope by myself. ; Therapist: Yeah ; Patient: Erm, no, I'll come by myself actually. ; Therapist: You sure? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: It'll just be easier. ; Patient: She'll just, you know, she'll just flat. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I mean I think it's important to say that we don't know for definite what this is. ; Therapist: We have to imagine that it is something like a cancer until we can prove what it is. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Erm, so we do everything very quickly. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And try and get some answers for you. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Erm, but we don't know any definite nothing certain at the minute. ; Therapist: Erm, but I do appreciate that I've just given you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Some scary news. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Erm, and they'll probably take a little bit of time. ; Therapist: Erm, so my door is open and I wonder if maybe we can get some answers. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Erm, I've taken the liberty of printing off a little bit of something about pancreatic cancer if that's what this is. ; Therapist: Erm, for you to have a bit of a read through. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Some of it's a little bit, a little bit scary and as I said we don't know as nothing certain yet. ; Therapist: But I wonder if you might want to have a bit of a read through of it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Before coming back to see me. ; Therapist: Erm, so what this does is it just explains a little bit about what the pancreas is. ; Patient: Right, okay. ; Therapist: A bit more detailed than I've been able to today. ; Therapist: Erm, and it talks about cancer in general. ; Patient: Mm hm. ; Therapist: And types of ways in which it can affect the pancreas and what sorts of treatments you can get. And then, how we diagnose it, different forms of scans ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you want to have a read through of this and then maybe, come back and see me tomorrow? ; Patient: Yeah I'll be back tomorrow, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? Okay. ; Therapist: I'm sorry to have to break this news to you like this ; Patient: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow ; Therapist: Okay.",

; Patient: No, I'm feeling a lot better now. ; Patient: It was a stupid thing to do. ; Patient: I'm not going to do it again. ; Therapist: I'm still really concerned about you and I need to know that you're going to be safe when you leave here. ; Therapist: I need you to fill out the safety plan to ensure that you have strategies in place to cope when you're feeling down. ; Patient: I don't really feel like filling out a plan. ; Patient: I don't need a plan. ; Therapist: Well, I think that you do need a plan. ; Therapist: You obviously needed a plan last night when you swallowed that whole bottle of pills. ; Therapist: And I want you to fill out the safety plan to ensure you have strategies in place in case you feel like this again. ; Therapist: It's a condition of your discharge. ; Patient: I really don't want to. ; Therapist: This is really concerning for me, Steph. ; Therapist: Perhaps you need to be admitted. ; Patient: Fine, I'll fill out the plan. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So Steph, I know you probably want to get out of here and go home and that you don't want to be admitted. ; Therapist: It must have been a really scary experience for you. ; Therapist: I want you to know though that any time you're feeling unsafe or at risk of harming yourself, you're always welcome to come back to the emergency department. ; Therapist: I'm wondering what you think might have been helpful for you if this happens again. ; Patient: I don't think it'll happen again. ; Patient: I was feeling really down but I don't really want to die. ; Therapist: Must have been a really hard experience to go through. ; Therapist: I'm wondering if you think it would be helpful to have some kind of plan in place or some strategies if by chance you feel like this again. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What do you think might be helpful for you to think about or to do if you did feel like this again? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I guess I could have called someone. ; Therapist: Oh, so that's a good idea. ; Therapist: Who do you think you might have called? ; Patient: Maybe my Aunt Jenny. ; Patient: She's great. ; Patient: She's really easy to talk to. ; Therapist: So it's good you have someone in your life that you can talk to. ; Therapist: What do you think stopped you from calling her last night? ; Patient: It was so late. ; Patient: I didn't want to call at like 3 in the morning. ; Patient: It would have woken her and my uncle and all of my cousins up and they'd probably just be mad. ; Therapist: So you're worried about disturbing them. ; Therapist: I imagine that your Aunt Jenny probably would have been okay with you calling her given the circumstances and how you were feeling. ; Therapist: Do you think you'd be okay with maybe having a conversation with her about her being an emergency contact for you? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: I'm wondering maybe if I could bring your dad in right now and we could maybe all talk about this together. ; Patient: Yeah, okay. ; Therapist: That's okay? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Hi Tom. ; Therapist: Steph and I are just having a conversation about safety planning and I'm wondering if you want to join us. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So Tom, Steph and I were just talking about who she might contact in the future if she was ever to feel this way again and she mentioned her Aunt Jenny. ; Therapist: Yes, I think that sounds good. ; Therapist: Steph and Jenny are pretty close. ; Therapist: I'm wondering Steph, are there any other things you can think of that would help you in the moment if you're feeling this down again? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I haven't been doing the stuff I usually do for fun like reading or going outside or hanging out with my friends even. ; Therapist: She also likes going for walks late at night when she can't sleep or isn't feeling good but I'm just not that comfortable with that. ; Therapist: So that's concerning for you? ; Patient: It helps a lot. ; Patient: The fresh air clears my head. ; Therapist: I'm wondering Tom, is there anything that Steph could do to make you feel more comfortable with her going for a walk? ; Therapist: I guess. ; Therapist: If she were to let me know before she left and maybe text me part way through to let me know where she is and when she might be home, that would help. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Steph, is that an okay compromise for you? ; Patient: Yeah, I guess. ; Therapist: Okay, so we've talked about a few strategies today and sometimes people find it helpful to write them down. ; Therapist: I actually have a template for a safety plan so we could write down what we talked about. ; Therapist: The other option is you could use the notes section of your phone. ; Therapist: Do either of those sound helpful for you? ; Patient: Maybe using the notes section on my phone. ; Patient: I always have it with me. ; Therapist: Okay, great. ; Therapist: So let's recap what we talked about today.",

; Patient: Um, you know, they think I have a drinking problem. ; Patient: My family. ; Therapist: Your family thinks you have a drinking problem? ; Patient: Yeah, so what really started this was this past weekend, um, they came to pick me up for my cousin's bridal shower and, uh, I was drunk when they came to get me so I couldn't go and now everybody's pretty pissed at me so here I am. ; Therapist: So they asked you to come into the agency? ; Patient: Yeah, you know, I don't want them to all hate me or anything so I agreed to come. ; Therapist: Do you believe that you have a drinking problem? ; Patient: I mean I like to drink. ; Patient: I don't, you know, I think it's okay. ; Therapist: You think it's okay? ; Patient: Yeah, I like it. ; Patient: I like drinking. ; Therapist: Come on, do you mind if I ask you a few questions today to your drinking? ; Patient: Oh, that's fine. ; Therapist: So how often do you drink now? ; Patient: Um, pretty much every day I would think. ; Patient: I drink every day on the weekends for sure. ; Patient: Um, but like, uh, during the week I'll go to the, whatever the best local happy hour is, you know, I'll just go about what's going on. ; Patient: So I'll go after work and have some drinks. ; Therapist: How about on the weekend? ; Patient: On the weekend I kind of keep to myself, you know, um, so I'll drink a little for whatever I have at the house. ; Patient: But yeah, I don't really go out a lot on the weekend, mostly to stay at home and, you know, drink whatever I have there. ; Therapist: And how much are you drinking, let's say on the weekend? ; Patient: Um, it's hard to keep track I think. ; Patient: I'd say a couple cases over maybe like two or three cases of beer throughout the weekend. ; Patient: If there's something on sale, you know, at the liquor store down the street, I'll get like a bottle of vodka or something to go along with it. ; Therapist: Alright, how about during the week? ; Patient: Um, during the week I just stay at the bar for a few hours, maybe have like six or seven drinks, and then go home. ; Patient: I mean, I'll have a glass of wine when I get home. ; Therapist: Are you drinking more than you want to? ; Patient: Um, I guess so. ; Patient: I mean, I've kind of tried to make a plan to just stay on the weekends to drink some, and that hasn't really kept up because I like to go to the happy hours and stuff. ; Patient: So. ; Therapist: So you've tried to cut down before and... ; Patient: I have, yeah. ; Patient: ...are not able to. ; Patient: Yeah, it's not really happening though. ; Patient: I don't really see it happening. ; Therapist: Do you have cravings for alcohol? ; Patient: Um, yeah, you could say so. ; Patient: Well, yeah, when I'm at work I want to drink, and when I'm out doing stuff I want to drink. ; Therapist: Are you using exclusively alcohol, or are there other drugs involved? ; Patient: Um, right now just alcohol is legal. ; Patient: I was inpatient a couple times for cocaine, but I've stopped that. ; Patient: It's not really something I want to do anymore, so. ; Therapist: When was the last time you were inpatient? ; Patient: Um, about four months ago, five months ago. ; Therapist: Four or five months ago? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And at that time you used cocaine? ; Patient: Yeah, I was using coke and alcohol. ; Therapist: And alcohol? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And why did you stop using cocaine? ; Patient: Um, well, I graduated from college. ; Patient: I was kind of a partier in college, and then I had to get a job, and it's kind of, I had a fear of losing my job because of the cocaine, and I had to get a drug test and stuff, so that's kind of in the back of my mind with that. ; Patient: So, yeah, I think the treatment helped with that. ; Therapist: Do you crave cocaine? ; Patient: Um, no, mostly just alcohol. ; Therapist: Just alcohol? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: How about your work? ; Therapist: Are you having any trouble keeping your job or your performance at your job been okay? ; Patient: Um, I think I'm not doing tip-top of what I could be doing, but, you know, it hasn't really been a problem. ; Patient: I haven't been threatened to be fired or anything like that, but, you know, I'll come and leave every once in a while, but I sneak in, so nobody knows. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Any social problems because of the alcohol use? ; Patient: Um, me with my family kind of right now, yeah. ; Patient: I'm not really getting along with them very well. ; Patient: Um, my friends, though, when I go out with them during the week, we get along fine, but, you know, they're just not really as fun as they used to be, so sometimes... ; Therapist: Your friends? ; Patient: Sometimes they want to do stuff and go to the movies or whatever, and they get a little mad because I don't want to go. ; Patient: I'd rather go, you know, party somewhere. ; Therapist: So you're having some social problems. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Not so much with your friends a little bit, but more with your family. ; Patient: More with my family, yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I guess my friends aren't that happy with me, but I don't think it's a huge deal. ; Patient: My best friend, I haven't talked to in a couple days because she, uh, she was mad at me for not coming to dinner with her the other night because I would rather frank, and she didn't want to do that, so... ; Therapist: So there have been some problems with the... ; Patient: Yeah, I guess so. ; Therapist: With the friends? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you found that, uh, you're engaging in any activities that are physically dangerous because of alcohol? ; Patient: Um... I've gotten hurt a couple times. ; Patient: I mean, I've fallen down the steps, but I'm not going, like, skydiving or anything, you know, so... ; Patient: I mean, I did sprain my ankle a couple months ago because I fell down the steps, but other than that, I've been okay. ; Therapist: Do you find that, um, you have any exacerbation of symptoms that you have already, like any medical or mental health problems made worse by the alcohol? ; Patient: No, I would say I'm pretty healthy. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So... did you notice a point after you started drinking when you had to increase the amount that you drank to get the same effect? ; Patient: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: When did that happen? ; Patient: Um... I think I kind of go through phases with it, you know. ; Patient: I'll drink a certain amount for a little while, then I'll notice, you know, I'm not even drunk anymore, so... I'll have to drink some more. ; Therapist: When was the last time you noticed that? ; Therapist: When you noticed you had to drink a lot more to get the same effect? ; Patient: I'd say, like, last weekend, you know, I was, uh, drinking a couple beers at my house and a few hours had passed and I drank probably, like, 10, 12 beers and I wasn't feeling anything, so... ; Patient: I started drinking a little faster and then I started, you know, feeling a little better. ; Therapist: How about withdrawal? ; Therapist: Do you have any symptoms of withdrawal when you stop drinking? ; Patient: Uh... ; Therapist: Like physical symptoms, anxiety? ; Patient: Well... I mean, I want some more, for sure. ; Therapist: Craving? ; Patient: Yeah, I crave some more, but I have a headache now. ; Therapist: Headache? ; Patient: Yeah, so... ; Therapist: Alright, Jackie, are you open to seeing a counselor here at the agency? ; Patient: Uh... I think that's what my mom really wants, so... ; Patient: So maybe I'll try it out once or twice and see what happens, but... ; Patient: I guess to make her happy, I will. ; Therapist: Alright, so you want to try it out? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I'll get you scheduled to see a counselor. ; Therapist: I want to thank you for telling me about what's going on and for answering my questions. ; Therapist: It's been helpful. ; Patient: Yeah, sure.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Asking children and teens about potential traumas they may have experienced can be challenging, particularly for clinicians who don't have a focus in mental health. ; Therapist: But we know that these adverse childhood experiences are prevalent and significantly impact lifelong health. ; Therapist: So it's essential that all pediatric healthcare providers feel comfortable and competent to do a routine screen for these adverse childhood experiences. ; Therapist: In the previous video we saw demonstrated how a clinician can use the ACE screening questionnaire to interview a parent and determine a child's ACE score. ; Therapist: Dr. Lawson met with 10-year-old Sam and his mom Dana and did a routine physical checkup on Sam and had no concerns for him. ; Therapist: She was about to finish the interview when Sam's mother raised that he was having difficulties at school and she also noted that there were some stresses at home. ; Therapist: Dr. Lawson interviewed Dana first on her own and gave Sam an ACE score of 3 based on what his mother was reporting. ; Therapist: She now meets with Sam on his own to ask him the same screening questions and confirm his score. ; Therapist: Hi Sam, thanks for waiting. ; Therapist: I talked to your mom a little bit about some of the things that were going on at home and school. ; Therapist: And now I'm going to spend a few minutes with you asking you some questions, the questions I ask all the kids. ; Therapist: Some of them are going to kind of fit for you and some of them might not fit so well. ; Therapist: But if there's things that you're curious about I'm asking or if you have questions as we're talking then feel free to ask me about why I'm asking something or ask any questions, okay? ; Therapist: The first thing I wanted to check in about was how have things been going at home? ; Patient: Oh, okay, I guess. ; Therapist: Okay, you guess? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And it sounds like there's a lot of things that have happened, lots of stressors and lots of things that have happened. ; Therapist: How's your mom doing with all of that stuff? ; Patient: Okay, I guess she's fine. ; Therapist: She's fine? ; Therapist: Have there ever been a time where you feel like your mom isn't able to get out of bed or do the things that she needs to do? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: So she's getting out of bed and she's looking after you? ; Patient: Most of the time, yeah. ; Therapist: Most of the time? ; Therapist: What does most of the time mean? ; Patient: Well, she's mostly doing a lot of, well she's doing a lot of stuff so she's doing things pretty good, I guess. ; Therapist: What are some of the things that you might think she might do a bit better? ; Patient: Oh, maybe getting some dinner, maybe? ; Patient: Because sometimes I just have to get both Cheerios. ; Therapist: So sometimes you're not having dinner? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're having Cheerios for dinner? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: How many times a week would you say that that's happening, that you're having Cheerios for dinner? ; Patient: Pretty much every day. ; Therapist: Pretty much every day? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And is your mom having Cheerios with you or are you on your own having Cheerios? ; Therapist: What's your mom doing? ; Patient: I'm mainly by myself. ; Therapist: You're by yourself having Cheerios? ; Therapist: And when you go to your fridge and you open it up, is there food in your fridge? ; Therapist: Have you ever had a time where there hasn't been enough food in your fridge? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Not really. ; Therapist: So there's food in your fridge? ; Patient: Unless I ate too much. ; Therapist: Unless you ate too much. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And have you been worried about having food? ; Therapist: Has that ever been a concern of yours? ; Therapist: It's getting pretty cold outside. ; Therapist: Do you have a coat and winter boots and things to make sure you're all set for the winter? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: My mom keeps saying that we might go to the mall or go shopping for one, but we never end up doing it because she's too busy with other things. ; Therapist: So how's your mom been doing? ; Patient: Okay, I guess. ; Patient: Pretty good. ; Therapist: Are there ever any times that she seems down or upset for days at a time? ; Therapist: That she hasn't been getting out of bed? ; Therapist: Or that she seems to be having a really tough time? ; Patient: She might be a little bit stressed because of Grandma. ; Therapist: Can you tell me more about what you mean by a little bit stressed? ; Patient: Well, they've been arguing and yelling a lot. ; Patient: So... ; Therapist: Who has Grandma and Mom? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: They've been arguing and yelling? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Can you tell me a little bit more about that? ; Patient: Well, they're just arguing about things. ; Patient: They're not very nice. ; Patient: I haven't listened to it very much. ; Patient: I just go to my room. ; Patient: So... ; Patient: It's not very nice. ; Therapist: And when they argue and yell, have there ever been times that you've been afraid that someone might get hurt? ; Patient: Once, maybe. ; Therapist: Once. ; Therapist: Can you tell me a bit about that time? ; Patient: Well, they were just getting really mean. ; Patient: Like, more than they usually would. ; Patient: Because it's happening quite a bit now. ; Patient: But... ; Patient: It wasn't too bad, I guess. ; Therapist: So the fighting between your Grandma and your Mom, how intense does it get? ; Therapist: Is it arguing or is it yelling, screaming? ; Therapist: And when they argue and yell, have there been times when anybody's been physical, used their fists or hands? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Any other way that they may have physically been fighting? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: What about throwing objects or...? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: And what happens to you when they're fighting? ; Therapist: Where are you? ; Patient: I just go to my room and try to ignore it. ; Therapist: So you're going to your room? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And kind of what happens afterwards? ; Patient: They kind of just stay away from each other for a while. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Stay away from each other. ; Therapist: So when they're fighting, what I'm hearing is it's words, that they're not physically hurting each other, and it gets pretty scary. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: When people talk to you, has anyone said mean things or hurtful things to you? ; Patient: Well, sometimes my Grandma's criticizing me a little bit. ; Patient: Like she'll tell me I'm not doing something right, but then won't help me with it. ; Patient: Like won't explain it. ; Therapist: So you're feeling criticized by Grandma? ; Therapist: What about Mom? ; Therapist: Has she ever said mean or hurtful things to you? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Sam, has anybody touched your body in an inappropriate way or a way that you didn't like? ; Patient: What do you mean? ; Therapist: Has anyone touched your private parts or touched you in a sexual way? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Sam, does anybody in your house ever hit or spank you? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: What about hurting your body? ; Therapist: Has anyone hurt your body? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: So when I say hurt, I mean things like hitting, kicking, punching, scratching. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: So no one's hurt you sexually or physically? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: With anyone in your house, has anyone been drinking or have you ever been worried about people drinking too much or getting drunk? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: What about other drugs? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: So you don't have any worries about your parents using drugs or alcohol? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: What about Grandma? ; Therapist: Anybody else in your family that you're worried about in that way? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: So Sam, how do you feel in your close relationships? ; Therapist: Do you feel loved and cared about and special? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: You're shrugging. ; Therapist: What's that mean? ; Patient: Well, my mom pays more attention to my little brother and then when I try to talk to my mom if I want something, she won't really listen that well. ; Patient: She just kind of keeps doing what she's doing. ; Patient: And then might later ask me again, what did you want? ; Patient: Not a lot though, really, at any time. ; Patient: How would you do that? ; Therapist: So you're not feeling loved? ; Therapist: Is there any place in your life with any adults or with anyone that you're feeling loved? ; Patient: I'd like to be in my room. ; Patient: I don't really have anyone else, no. ; Therapist: So if you had a problem or you were hurt in some way or something was happening, who would you go to for help or what would you do? ; Patient: I wouldn't have anybody. ; Patient: I'd just go to my room and think. ; Patient: I just like being in my room sometimes. ; Therapist: And has anybody in your family ever been in jail or in prison? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: So the stressors in your house and what's going on making your mom not be there for you as much. ; Therapist: What do you think are some of those stressful things? ; Patient: Well, probably because my grandma's fighting with her a lot and also my dad moving away because they were divorced a year ago. ; Therapist: Your mom told me that your dad and your mom aren't together anymore and that he's moved out to DC. ; Therapist: Do you see your dad? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: When was the last time you saw him? ; Patient: A year ago. ; Therapist: And is there a plan for you to see him? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: What I've heard is that there's some stressors and some things that are hard for you in your life and you talk to me about the arguing that's happening between your mom and your grandma. ; Therapist: That your dad has moved away. ; Therapist: That you're not always in the right clothes and you have to fix some of your meals. ; Therapist: And that you're not always feeling loved and special. ; Therapist: But you've also told me that nobody's hurting you in a physical or in a verbal or sexual way. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nobody's saying mean things to you. ; Therapist: That you're not worried about your mom emotionally and that she's not worried about her all the time, struggling more emotionally. ; Therapist: And that nobody you know is in prison or has been in prison. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And you don't have any concerns about drugs or drinking or in your home. ; Therapist: Sam, do you think some of those stressors are what's making it hard for you at school? ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: Probably, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Why do you think that might be? ; Patient: Maybe because I'm thinking about that and then I'm not thinking about what I'm doing at the moment and then I don't get very much. ; Patient: I don't get a lot done. ; Therapist: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, Sam. ; Therapist: That when things are stressful at home that kids have trouble concentrating and it affects them at school. ; Therapist: So I'm going to talk to your mom more and we're going to try and figure out a way that I can help you and your mom with some of that stuff. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Therapist: So thanks for coming in. ; Therapist: Dr. Lawson's interview with Sam confirms that his ACE score is 3 as he endorses loss of a parent due to divorce, physical neglect and also a sense of emotional deprivation. ; Therapist: So we know that Sam is at elevated risk for a host of physical and mental illnesses beginning in adolescence that could persist throughout his life. ; Therapist: But Dr. Lawson's now in a position to meet again with Sam and his mother and collaboratively develop a focused and evidence-based intervention plan that should help change Sam's lifetime health trajectory. ; Therapist: Clinicians can visit the online trauma toolkit website for a list of resources on these evidence-based interventions which have been shown to be helpful for children like Sam and their families.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, Sasha. ; Therapist: How you doing today? ; Patient: I'm all right, thanks. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing okay. ; Therapist: Thank you for asking. ; Therapist: I understand that you've been having some difficulty with some symptoms. ; Therapist: Is that right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about what's been going on? ; Patient: Yeah, for the past maybe couple weeks, I guess, few weeks, I have these morning meetings once a week at work and I have to make a presentation. ; Patient: And every time I go to present, it's my turn and I start getting really nervous. ; Therapist: Start getting really nervous. ; Therapist: So, morning meeting at work and so does each person at the meeting present in a row? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: We all take turns. ; Therapist: You all take turns. ; Therapist: And when you start to feel nervous when it's your time to talk or before or after that? ; Patient: No, usually the kind at the start of the meeting because I know I'm going to have to. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: I've been to about 10 of us and I always seem to be one of the last few to go like six or seven kind of in line to present. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, there's around 10 people at the meeting? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And as luck would have it, you tend to be toward the end. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, can you describe what's happening, let's say, from the beginning of the meeting in terms of what you're experiencing? ; Patient: So, when I walk in, I'm usually okay and say good morning to everybody and then my boss calls me to order and that's usually when it starts. ; Patient: It kind of starts like maybe like butterflies in my stomach kind of. ; Patient: And then after he makes his report and then it just starts going around the room and my heart starts to beat faster, my palms get sweaty and I just start to feel really nervous. ; Patient: I've realized that I might be, I kind of, I start to tune out some of the other presentations because I start to become focused on how I'm feeling. ; Therapist: So, you're focused on the physical sensation being nervous and the mental sensation and you're not really hearing what they're saying? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Is that what they're saying? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, go on. ; Therapist: So, you have these physical symptoms, this nervousness, what happens then? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: By the time it's my turn to present, I start, I just, I'm almost like just almost shaking. ; Patient: I notice that my hands are a little off and so I'll keep my hands down like in my lap and just so that I don't want anybody to see them shaking like that. ; Patient: I have a paper in front of me that I just kind of read from but when I start reading, my voice is a little shaky and I kind of stutter and trip over my words and I just, I feel like I'm not making good presentations and that it's not looking good to my boss. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, in the moment when it's your turn to present, you're still feeling that same nervousness like that doesn't go away at all. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And you're trying to hold your body kind of still like almost like keep control. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And then your voice is kind of, sounds like crackly or breaking up as you're trying to present like bullet points like on a... ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Like an outline. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: What happens when you have read the last point? ; Patient: Well, when I'm done, it takes a little bit for everything to calm down but then I'm consumed by the idea that my boss thinks I did a terrible job and that he's regretting putting me in this position and that I can't make good reports or that I didn't report the right stuff, the right information to him and so it doesn't really go away. ; Patient: It's almost like my mind just shifts on what I'm anxious about. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, the nervousness, that stronger feeling of nervousness, that goes away. ; Therapist: It's replaced by a more general feeling of nervousness about how your boss will think of you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because of the presentation quality. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because as you're presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling, he's picking up on that and you're aware of that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How long have you noticed these symptoms that appear in this way? ; Patient: You know, when I was an undergrad in college, I had to make some presentations from time to time and I would get nervous when I would make the presentations and I just, maybe most people are afraid of public speaking so I kind of thought that maybe that's what it was, you know, just doing a presentation in front of like 30 something people and so it didn't really bother me then. ; Patient: I figured it was just normal and I always got decent grades on my presentation so it never really bothered me. ; Patient: So I really feel like it's only been an issue in the last few weeks. ; Therapist: The last few weeks is when you noticed this. ; Therapist: You had some nervousness before presenting. ; Therapist: You were in college but you just kind of thought of it as normal. ; Therapist: It didn't really impair your ability to present. ; Therapist: It didn't affect your grades or anything. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to what's going on? ; Patient: I'm not sure if it has any bearing. ; Patient: My mom, she doesn't like to speak in public. ; Patient: I know I used to talk to her about how I feel nervous about making presentations in school and she would say, oh, you can buy it on as honey and so I don't know if that means anything. ; Therapist: So whatever you have going on, you think that maybe she has that going on too. ; Patient: Maybe. ; Therapist: The same set of symptoms at least. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean I've asked her, I've told her about this and she hasn't been in a situation where she's had to do this kind of presentations like in a small group like this and so I can't compare it to that but I mean she has said that she's gotten nervous before. ; Therapist: Any feelings of sadness or anything like that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Like after I make the presentation at work and then I do start feeling really sad, like I said, because then I feel like my boss isn't satisfied with my performance and that he's going to regret his decision to give me this position and so yeah, it definitely makes me sad. ; Patient: I feel disappointed in myself. ; Therapist: Do you have any substance use going on, alcohol, anything else? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I have a drink every now and then. ; Patient: It's very, very rare. ; Therapist: I know this is something recent for you but in these meetings so far, has the nervousness ever caused you to leave the room before they came around to your turn? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I've managed to control it I guess to where I can stay there. ; Patient: Like I said, I've zoned out sometimes when other people have been presenting and I feel bad about that too because I feel like they have important information to share with me and I should give them the same respect of paying attention but I become focused on what's going on inside like my heart beating and my hands and so I zone out on them sometimes but no, I push through it and I do my presentation. ; Therapist: Are you ever worried about what they're thinking about? ; Therapist: You mentioned what your boss could be thinking about you. ; Therapist: Have you ever worried about what the other workers at the table are thinking about you? ; Patient: Yeah, sometimes because I feel like I'm the newest member of the management team and so I feel like they're kind of like, what is up with this chick? ; Therapist: Why can't she get it together? ; Patient: But there's been one person who's been really supportive and she's been like, hey, you did great today and great information and things like that so that kind of helps me feel better but I guess at the end of the day to me, it's really my boss's opinion that matters because he's my boss. ; Therapist: Have you ever felt, you mentioned you were nervous at the beginning of the meeting. ; Therapist: Have you ever felt nervous well in advance of the meeting? ; Patient: When I'm preparing like that morning to go to work and it's one of those like, okay, I got this meeting at nine and I start to think about it like on my way into work but I don't start feeling anything until I'm actually in the room. ; Therapist: Alright, so you have this nervousness, it's fairly intense, pretty much only at these meetings. ; Therapist: It's been bothering you for a few weeks. ; Therapist: Something new, something a little frightening for you. ; Therapist: Alright, we'll get you set up with treatment. ; Therapist: I'll get you in to see somebody in the next few days if that works for you. ; Patient: Yeah, that'd be great. ; Therapist: And I appreciate you spending this time with me. ; Therapist: It's been helpful. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks, Sasha.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, I'm Jordan. ; Therapist: It's so nice to meet you. ; Patient: Hi, I'm Judy. ; Therapist: How are you doing? ; Patient: I'm pretty good. ; Therapist: Well welcome, sit down. ; Therapist: Have you ever been to a counseling session before? ; Patient: No, this will be my first time. ; Therapist: Well okay then, so just a little bit about us. ; Therapist: We're a counseling center and we work with people with a range of different things going on with them. ; Therapist: And between the two of us we can work through whatever is going on with you in your life. ; Therapist: But before we begin, I just wanted to let you know that everything you say here is confidential. ; Therapist: Unless you're intending to harm yourself or other people and then we're obligated to report it for their own safety. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yeah, that makes sense too. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So I also just want to forewarn you, today is going to be a lot of questions. ; Therapist: Just trying to get some background of where you're at and where you want to go. ; Therapist: Also, would it be okay with you if I write down some things as we talk? ; Therapist: Yeah, that's totally fine. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So to begin, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? ; Patient: Yeah, like I said, my name is Judy. ; Patient: I'm 42. ; Patient: I have two kids. ; Patient: Max, who's eight years old, and Chelsea, who is six. ; Patient: Max plays soccer. ; Patient: He's very active around the home. ; Patient: Like almost too active. ; Patient: And Chelsea is a little know-all, but keeps me in line. ; Patient: And kids are both very active, pretty good in school, get along pretty well, and they're good. ; Patient: They're good kids. ; Patient: Sweet kids. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: I'm so glad. ; Therapist: So I'd love to hear what's been going on from your perspective and why you're excited to come here today. ; Patient: Well, I have a lot of negative stuff going on in my life right now. ; Patient: I've been very stressed lately because I lost my job pretty recently. ; Patient: It was a rough time and I haven't been handling it very well according to my husband. ; Patient: And he told me that I had to come to counseling where he would leave me. ; Patient: So that's why I'm here. ; Therapist: I'm definitely glad that you came. ; Therapist: When did you notice this change in yourself or notice that this was a problem? ; Patient: Well, I lost my job about a month ago. ; Patient: I got laid off a month ago. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it seems like losing your job has really affected your relationship with your husband and family. ; Therapist: You said you have two other kids, that you love with them, right? ; Patient: Yes, I have two kids Max and Chelsea. ; Patient: I love them a lot and we live all together, the four of us. ; Patient: The children are wonderful, but I feel like I haven't been a great mom recently to them or my husband. ; Patient: I think that's unfair to me. ; Therapist: So that leads great into my next question. ; Therapist: What's your relationship with your husband like? ; Patient: Well, we've had our ups and downs like every marriage. ; Patient: I spend a lot of time with the kids. ; Patient: He works a lot. ; Patient: He's not very close with the kids. ; Patient: But I'm not as close with my parents. ; Patient: I'm very close with my mom. ; Patient: And she's been there for me a lot in the past. ; Therapist: Interesting. ; Therapist: And how long have you been married for? ; Patient: Just seven years. ; Therapist: And what do you like to do in your free time with your family? ; Therapist: Do you spend time with them? ; Patient: Yeah, I go to the gym a lot. ; Patient: That's more of an individual activity for me. ; Patient: It's something that releases a lot of my stress. ; Patient: And that's kind of how I, I don't know, it's part of who I am. ; Patient: But with the kids, I like them and I drive them all over the place all the time. ; Patient: I like to practice, I like to practice everything. ; Patient: So there's not a lot of time for me to really have time with my kids. ; Patient: But I don't know, I like to, you know, we read together every night. ; Patient: I try to make time for the kids. ; Patient: And I take them to the beach when it's warm. ; Patient: You know, there's a lot of things that we do together. ; Therapist: Good, good. ; Therapist: Do you find you can draw support from your family? ; Therapist: You mentioned your aunt, but... ; Patient: Well, I don't really want to warn the kids because they think they're so young. ; Patient: And I think they know that something's up, but I don't really know to what extent they know. ; Patient: But I am closer to my aunt. ; Patient: She's always been there for me. ; Patient: But my husband and I have had a rough patch recently since I lost my job. ; Therapist: So, when you're stressed, you sometimes go to your aunt, but do you turn to people for comfort? ; Therapist: Or do you have an activity that helps you calm down or another method that helps you cope? ; Patient: Like I said, I have been going to the gym a lot, but I haven't been doing that as much recently. ; Patient: Maybe, I'm not really sure why I haven't made time for it. ; Patient: I haven't really felt like myself recently. ; Patient: But a lot of times, I turn to other things more than people. ; Therapist: What kind of things do you mean? ; Patient: Like substances, drugs and alcohol? ; Patient: Yeah, I've never used them before, but I feel like it helps me relax, calm down. ; Patient: And a lot of times, it's something that I feel like I need to be, I guess, relaxed. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you find that's affecting your family? ; Therapist: Your relationships with them or the way you interact? ; Patient: It didn't for a while. ; Patient: But like I said, about a month ago was a turning point. ; Patient: And when I lost my job, I do feel very ashamed. ; Patient: I made a horrible mistake the other day. ; Patient: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I drove with them in the car after I had a few drinks and they got pulled over. ; Patient: I felt like I endangered my family. ; Patient: I felt like I was being a bad mom and that was a really big life to me. ; Therapist: That must have been pretty scary for you. ; Therapist: But if you think of it this way, it could be a turning point. ; Therapist: And you now notice what you're doing wrong and how you can improve it. ; Therapist: So it's progress that you're admitting that and that you do need to improve on certain things. ; Therapist: Do you take any other medications? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What medications? ; Patient: Oxycodone. ; Therapist: And why do you have a prescription for that? ; Patient: Well, I had surgery a few years back and I got fulfilled. ; Patient: I didn't really finish all the pills, but I've been taking them recently when I feel like I need to. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And how often do you take them? ; Patient: I've taken three over the course of a month, but I know that I shouldn't be. ; Therapist: How do you feel when you take them? ; Patient: It's numbing and it allows me to relax and escape from the issues in the home and workplace. ; Patient: I guess not really a workplace anymore, but I know that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing and I know that it's wrong. ; Patient: And I guess that's why I'm here. ; Therapist: How has your family ever had a history of drug abuse problems and drinking? ; Patient: My dad, I think, was an alcoholic for a while, not really diagnosed. ; Patient: I grew up with a lot of that in the home. ; Patient: A lot of just genuine parents didn't mesh too well or a lot of infighting in the home. ; Patient: And the older I get, the more that I think that it might have been alcohol related on my father's part. ; Patient: My mother definitely not. ; Patient: My father though, and I believe that his father had a problem similar to that as well. ; Therapist: And is it the first time you found yourself turning to it? ; Patient: A few times in college I found myself depressed, confused about growing up, getting a career. ; Patient: I wasn't an addict in college, but I would do things with the intention of feeling better and forgetting. ; Patient: I think that's kind of something that's been beneath the surface for a while. ; Patient: When I find myself stressful, I can sink back into that. ; Therapist: Have you ever experienced any form of sexual assault or abuse that maybe made you turn to alcohol? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Are you having trouble eating or sleeping? ; Patient: Eating, yeah, not as much or as healthy as I have before, but sleeping absolutely because of stress. ; Patient: I find myself not sleeping as well. ; Therapist: Yeah, that definitely happens with stress. ; Therapist: And what's a typical day like for you? ; Patient: Well, lately my husband's been taking care of the kids more because of last week and the incident with getting pulled over. ; Patient: He doesn't trust me with the kids, which I guess they understand. ; Patient: He doesn't trust me to drive kids places because of last week, so he usually will take them to school and I'll make him late for work and that makes him upset. ; Patient: And there's an argument there. ; Patient: When I wake up, I'll have a drink, so I'm not too hung up from the night before. ; Patient: Then I watch my show, I get the mail, and usually there's a bill, so I have a few more drinks. ; Patient: And then I try to start dinner, but it's usually hard because I'm pretty intoxicated, but I start dinner and usually at the night is the letter of a shit show and the kids are frustrated and you figure it out. ; Therapist: And are you feeling sad or down in addition to being stressed? ; Patient: I'm pretty sad. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And when you're sad, do you turn to your faith? ; Therapist: Have you been praying a lot? ; Patient: Some I used to, but I don't as much anymore. ; Patient: It's hard to believe that somebody's watching over me with all this negative stuff. ; Therapist: Does other things give you hope besides your faith? ; Patient: The kids. ; Patient: Watching them play together and be together really gives me a lot of hope. ; Patient: I love seeing them do what they love to do and I love it when I know that what I do can enable them to enjoy their activities. ; Patient: But it's been hard to do that recently because I drive them to school, I've been taking them to activities because my husband's been doing this for me. ; Patient: So it's getting kind of empty-fills with them getting into the family. ; Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. ; Therapist: So we can start to meet on a regular basis and try to work through all these things together. ; Therapist: From what I've collected, from what you kind of just told me, you're really stressed about losing your job and so you want to find different ways to cope with your stress. ; Therapist: And then also try to rebuild the trust in your family, with your husband, your kids that they may have lost during the driving incident last week. ; Patient: Sounds a lot like what I want to do. ; Patient: I hope that you're able to help me with that. ; Therapist: So in order for this to be most effective, let's brainstorm some small steps we can work on. ; Therapist: Maybe make a list together and it can be very small unless it's not too overwhelming at first. ; Therapist: So for instance, to work on the drinking thing, we can start by cutting down the number of drinks slowly today. ; Therapist: And it can be really hard to just stop cold turkey because you can get withdrawal symptoms or it may make you even more stressed out. ; Therapist: So I want you to be able to be confident in the goal you're setting and in yourself. ; Therapist: So can you do one last drink each day or something like that. ; Therapist: So what would you like to achieve from our work together in the future, by the end? ; Patient: Yeah, I hear what you're saying. ; Patient: I understand. ; Patient: I guess I don't want to stop moving completely. ; Patient: But it sounds like a very logical solution at this point. ; Patient: It doesn't sound like something I'd be able to do at this point immediately. ; Patient: We can maybe get there. ; Patient: I'm not really sure if we can completely get there. ; Patient: And then after that, I'd really like to fix my relationship with my family. ; Patient: So if I go to my husband, we can patch things with my parents too. ; Therapist: So let's start with a goal regarding drinking. ; Therapist: What do you think is a reasonable thing for yourself? ; Patient: I can start having four drinks a day, maybe four maybe. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: That's a good one. ; Therapist: Then in a few days you can try having three, and two, and one, until you don't need to turn to alcohol for comfort, and so on and so forth. ; Therapist: If you need a different way to find comfort, you can try stress relieving activities. ; Therapist: So what would be a good activity for you to do? ; Patient: I think I could try journaling, maybe drawing or painting. ; Patient: I did a lot of art in college. ; Patient: I'd really like to get back into that and I would just call it a day. ; Therapist: That's a really great idea. ; Therapist: Then in the future, what are you thinking regarding your career? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I don't think anyone's going to want somebody as dressed up as me right now. ; Therapist: What was your old job again? ; Patient: I was a staff captain. ; Therapist: Well, you don't need to jump right back into work again. ; Therapist: That can be a way in the future, or maybe a month or two. ; Therapist: If you think about it in the future, what would be your goal? ; Patient: I guess I'd like to get back in the game, but I think more important for me is that I patch things up with my family. ; Patient: But I do need to try making money again to support the family. ; Patient: It's not logical for me to assume that I can go a long time without it. ; Patient: That's why I want to fix my issues, get back in the job, and see what I can do. ; Therapist: What kind of things do you think could help rebuild the trust within your family? ; Patient: I could block out some time each week to really spend a long time with each of my family members, my kids and my husband. ; Patient: Kids I don't think really understand what's going on, so I don't have to work as hard with them, but I would still love to. ; Patient: I just really do need to work in relationship with my husband, go back to what things we used to do together, and see what we can do to get back there. ; Therapist: A way you could do that is try family therapy or couples counseling. ; Therapist: Would you be interested in something like that? ; Patient: Yeah, that's definitely something we could do. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So, I'm very happy that you came to talk to me today. ; Therapist: From what I heard, it sounds like losing your job has been incredibly stressful for you. ; Therapist: And you turned to substance abuse to try and relieve some of that stress. ; Therapist: Do you feel a little bit better after talking to me? ; Patient: I absolutely do. ; Patient: I feel like the weight has really been lifted off my shoulders, and the fact that somebody is going to be in charge of my recovery, I think is huge. ; Therapist: We'll definitely be working hand in hand, so you're in charge of your recovery, but I'm definitely here to help you along the way. ; Therapist: I really am looking forward to our next session together. ; Patient: Me too. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So, until our next session, I want you to try and journal every time that you're feeling upset or like you need to drink, stress, and then bring your journal and we can go through and find the times you felt like you needed substance to help you. ; Therapist: And in addition to that, maybe try and cut back on your drinking, maybe one less glass or something of wine or anything for now. ; Therapist: And then next time, let me know how that goes. ; Patient: Yeah, I can totally make sure of that. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So, I want you to know that I really do believe in you and that you can get through this. ; Therapist: And if you continue to come to our sessions, we really can work together to accomplish these goals that we just discussed. ; Patient: Thanks. ; Patient: I hope so too. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Have a good day. ; Patient: Thank you.",

; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you have been for about a week? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do you feel like your sleep habits have changed? ; Patient: I mean, they have. ; Patient: I haven't been sleeping as much. ; Patient: I haven't needed it really. ; Patient: I only need a few hours it seems like but it's been fine because I haven't been tired, I haven't been, you know, irritable or anything during the day and at night I get a few hours of sleep but for the rest of the time I'm like, you know, either working on work or my house or whatever so I mean, I'm sleeping less but it's not an issue. ; Therapist: Alright, so you're sleeping less but you don't feel tired at all? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: You feel okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself more easily distracted by anything? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Things around you? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: How are things done at work? ; Therapist: How about at home? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, so my dining room, I've been like, new china and stuff like that so I've gotten everything set up. ; Patient: You know, I hadn't finished unpacking all my boxes from when I moved in so I've gotten all the boxes unpacked. ; Patient: You know, even like things like placemats and whatever, like it looks like a home now and I'm really liking what I'm doing. ; Therapist: Alright, so you're accomplishing a lot. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Now, when your brother had brought you in, he had mentioned some shopping and that's one of the things he was concerned about. ; Patient: Yeah, well, so on the weekend, I had gone ahead and went shopping and I kind of went on a shopping spree and I had bought, like I said, my new china and I had gotten some kitchen utensils too and a couple things for around the house, like home decor. ; Patient: And I called him because I had ran out of space to take everything. ; Patient: I was at the mall so I was hitting a lot of different stores. ; Patient: And I had run out of space to put everything in because I really wanted to actually get a new dining room set, like tables and chairs and maybe a cabinet. ; Patient: He has an SUV, so I called him to see if he could come and so I could purchase the items, but he said he wasn't, he couldn't come out. ; Patient: I guess he kind of said he was worried about you spending that much money, which I don't, you know, I don't know why he would be just from me calling him, but I think that's why he was concerned. ; Patient: But he didn't come. ; Patient: I didn't get the dining room set or anything. ; Therapist: You remember how much you spent? ; Patient: I don't know exactly because there's lots of different stores, but you know, I have a couple different credit cards. ; Patient: The one credit card I used was declined by the end. ; Patient: So it was probably, you know, I didn't need to get the dining room set. ; Patient: I could have used a different credit card, but obviously it's been enough. ; Therapist: Do you feel like you spent more than you usually would spend in a trip to the mall? ; Patient: Well, you know, I never really go on shopping sprees. ; Patient: I never like treat myself like that. ; Patient: So I mean, yes, but I, again, like I haven't, you know, I needed all those things that I got from my apartment. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a time in the past when you felt this way where you felt really good? ; Patient: Not like this, no. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: It's the first time. ; Patient: Like I just feel like, you know, life's falling into place right now. ; Therapist: Life's falling into place. ; Therapist: So you're feeling pretty good. ; Therapist: You feel like things are going your way. ; Patient: I do. ; Therapist: You're getting a lot accomplished. ; Therapist: Any sadness or anything like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Any change in appetite? ; Therapist: You seem to have a good amount of energy. ; Therapist: Any feelings of worthlessness? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Nothing. ; Therapist: Any thoughts of death or dying? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Drug and alcohol use? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How about medical conditions? ; Patient: None. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a time in the past when you felt depressed? ; Patient: I mean, I have been depressed in the past, yes. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: But I mean, I feel like that's, I feel like I was almost a different person then. ; Patient: And I feel like, you know, I haven't had any of those symptoms, you know, and I feel like it's a new me. ; Therapist: It's a new you? ; Patient: Yep. ; Therapist: So do you know what happened with the depression in the past? ; Therapist: Like, did you end up in the hospital or being treated some other way? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: There's just no treatment? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I mean, I've talked to people before about being depressed, but I was never hospitalized for it. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: But you believe you were depressed? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Now or back then, did you see or hear things that other people couldn't see or hear? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Not now or back then? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right, Sherry, answering these questions has been helpful to me. ; Therapist: I appreciate it. ; Therapist: I'm going to get you over to see a counselor in just a few moments. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: I know that you're feeling pretty good, but I'd like them to talk to you for just a bit. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Is that okay?

; Patient: What do you mean kind of between part of me that wants to settle down, but then part of me that also wants to pursue my career and what I'm doing? ; Therapist: So we have a part that wants to settle down and a part that wants to keep going with the career. ; Therapist: So for this two chair, what I'd like to do is in the chair where you're seated now, this will be the emotional self, in this case the side that wants to pursue the career. ; Therapist: From what I saw before, that seems like we're more... ; Patient: That's what I really want, yes. ; Therapist: You're more emotionally connected, that's what you want. ; Patient: Yeah, that's what I want. ; Therapist: So this will be the side of you that has the needs and the wants and more the emotion. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So that's who you'll be in this chair. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Therapist: In the other chair, let's have that critic that's inside, that internal critic that's advocating for settling down, for getting married, for having kids. ; Therapist: In a way it represents a societal pressure. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do those two sides seem separate to you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You feel like you can be the emotional self here and the internal critic there? ; Patient: I think so. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I think you remember how this works. ; Therapist: You'll be talking to, in this case, the internal critic. ; Therapist: So the internal critic's on the side of settling down, getting married. ; Therapist: And then when you're ready to have the critic respond, you'll switch to that chair and respond to the emotional need-driven and wanting self. ; Therapist: Make sense? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So whenever you're ready, go ahead and speak directly to the internal critic. ; Patient: I want to finish what I'm doing and I want to finish what I started. ; Patient: I've worked so hard on my career path and I'm so close to finishing. ; Patient: And I want to finish for me. ; Patient: I want to accomplish those goals that I've set for myself. ; Patient: It's something I'm passionate about. ; Therapist: So you made your statement. ; Therapist: Are you ready to switch? ; Therapist: Okay, go ahead and switch. ; Therapist: So now you're the internal critic. ; Patient: There's always time to pursue a career, but I need to focus on what's expected of me at this time. ; Patient: I'm the best age for having kids. ; Patient: I have a loving boyfriend who is ready and wants to get married and settle down. ; Patient: And you are being selfish by just following a path that you can take at any time. ; Therapist: So the internal critic cues in the emotional side, in this case the career side, being selfish. ; Therapist: And notice your posture is very linear and you're upright. ; Therapist: And notice you kind of put your hand out a little bit when you were talking. ; Therapist: Try to think of the internal critic's body movements. ; Therapist: Try to act that out a little bit. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I think it's accusations. ; Patient: I just want to tell the emotional part that it's being stupid. ; Patient: You're not acting in the best interest of everyone else. ; Patient: You want to jump at it. ; Therapist: You want to jump at the emotional side? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So that's the internal critic. ; Therapist: Are you ready to respond back to the internal critic from the emotional side? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So the internal critic is just called selfish, among other things. ; Therapist: This is your response. ; Patient: It feels like I'm being attacked. ; Patient: And I don't think it's wrong to think about myself and what I'm truly passionate about. ; Therapist: Let me interrupt you. ; Therapist: So your hands, they're pointing back toward the career emotional self. ; Therapist: What can you do with your hands that really embody what you want to communicate to the internal critic? ; Therapist: Is there anything else you'd want to do? ; Therapist: Right now they're pointing toward you. ; Patient: They're pointing towards me to protect myself from what the critic is saying. ; Patient: I just want to push that back towards the critic. ; Therapist: When you use that motion, you're pushing the internal critic away. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: So I don't need to feel guilty. ; Patient: I don't need to feel selfish for wanting to follow my dreams. ; Therapist: Does the internal critic have something to say back? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: I think the critic... ; Patient: I'll try. ; Patient: I'll try. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you've now pushed the emotional side, pushed the critic away. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: And I think the critic feels like it understands where the emotional side of me is coming from. ; Patient: Like I can recognize why it's so important and why working so hard is worth that sense of accomplishment that's going to come with it and how it's going to, in the long run, help provide for all these extra things that I want to... ; Patient: like my family in the future. ; Patient: I can see that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So the internal critic is... ; Therapist: Now you have your hands down here is the internal critic. ; Therapist: Is the internal critic less angry, less assertive? ; Patient: Less pushy. ; Therapist: Less pushy. ; Patient: Less pushy. ; Patient: Yeah, it's not as critical, truthfully. ; Patient: I feel like the pressure isn't weighing on either's shoulders. ; Patient: You know what I mean? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So the critic is more separated now, maybe a little bit, but also has a different outlook. ; Patient: More quiet. ; Patient: It's not like always yelling at me. ; Patient: Because I think it... I mean, sometimes it might still say something, but not in the urgency that it had before. ; Therapist: So the critic has lost some of its vigor and determination. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So move back to the emotional and then just face toward me. ; Therapist: What have you gained here through your communication back and forth with the internal critic? ; Patient: I feel calmer. ; Patient: I feel like the critic has always been a part of me, but that part of me is more... ; Patient: It's not as assertive. ; Patient: It's not as intense right now. ; Patient: It's calm. ; Patient: I think that the emotional part of me was able to win the argument, per se, because that's what I want. ; Therapist: So at the end of this conflict, after we split into the two parts here, at the end of this conflict is eventually a decision. ; Therapist: It's a decision to pursue a career or settle down. ; Therapist: Do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Because I feel like I can stay on... my decision is and has been to stay on my career path, but now I feel less guilty for doing it. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So that's really been your decision all along, but the internal critic was harassing you this whole time. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Harassment is a good word. ; Therapist: Today you were able to shove that internal critic back a little and allow that internal critic to see how strong you feel with the decision you've made. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Is that accurate? ; Patient: Very much so. ; Therapist: Do you feel it was a helpful technique for you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I do. ; Patient: I think that separating the two sides helped me realize which one felt stronger. ; Therapist: So it was able to give you some clarity? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, let's... I want you to reflect on what's happened here between now and the next session. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I guess kind of a lot happened and it seems like you've gained clarity for your decision and then we'll pick up with the next session and see how things have progressed with... ; Therapist: See if that internal critic is still harassing you or if it kind of stays back and if you have more peace with the decision. ; Therapist: Does that sound like a plan? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Thanks, Erica. ; Therapist: I'll see you next week. ; Patient: Thanks.",

; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So I've been talking to Victor and he's been telling me about how he's had less interest in things, he's having trouble sleeping, he's feeling sad all the time. ; Therapist: And it does sound like he's been suffering from what we call a major depression. ; Therapist: And there's a couple of treatments that I want to talk about. ; Therapist: Do you know what medications Victor is on? ; Therapist: Yeah, so I actually brought a list because there's quite a few. ; Therapist: I can certainly give you all. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Therapist: Okay, so on this list it says about sort of what medical illnesses he's had and hospitalizations and surgeries as well. ; Therapist: There's a couple of treatments for depression. ; Therapist: One is medication and one is also doing some interventions within the school and within the family. ; Therapist: And there's a lot of things to think about, but it seems like things in the school have been really not going well. ; Therapist: And that's been a major contribution to his sadness.",

; Patient: I've been feeling really low and I think I might be depressed. ; Therapist: You think you might be depressed? ; Therapist: Have you ever felt this way in the past? ; Patient: I mean years ago I had some of these similar things but I didn't really think about it much and this was going on for like, I've been feeling this way for like a month and I think something's wrong. ; Therapist: You've been having feelings of sadness, hopelessness?

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Emma, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing good, thanks. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well, thank you for asking. ; Therapist: I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothering you lately. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about that? ; Patient: Well, I just moved into an apartment and it's the first time that I'm on my own. ; Patient: I kind of had heard that someone got robbed and ever since then I'm kind of nervous about my apartment getting robbed. ; Therapist: Someone who's robbed near where you live? ; Patient: Yeah, someone in the same complex. ; Patient: So sometimes when I'm sleeping I'll wake up in the middle of the night and I'll think did I lock the door? ; Patient: Is the door unlocked? ; Patient: And I can't fall back asleep. ; Therapist: How long does it take you to fall back asleep? ; Patient: Sometimes it takes maybe an hour or two. ; Therapist: And what are you thinking about during that time? ; Patient: I'm just worried that I left the door unlocked and sometimes I'll hear sounds and I think maybe someone's in the apartment or I just get nervous. ; Patient: I just get scared that the door's unlocked. ; Therapist: That sounds scary. ; Therapist: You said a couple hours, you stay awake. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's a while. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So this is troubling for you. ; Therapist: Have you ever gotten up and checked the door? ; Patient: No, I stay in bed and I just try to, but I just think about it. ; Therapist: All right, so you just keep thinking about it. ; Therapist: Does it get worse as that time goes on or does it get better? ; Therapist: What happens? ; Patient: It gets worse. ; Patient: I mean I try to fall back asleep and I stay in bed and I just think maybe I did leave the door unlocked and then I just keep thinking that maybe it is unlocked. ; Therapist: So it kind of keeps cycling through the same. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you ever do anything to try to get those thoughts to go away like focusing on something else? ; Patient: Well, I have like a ceiling fan above me, so sometimes I'll just like count how many times it goes around and just try to distract myself from thinking about it, but I still think about the door being unlocked. ; Patient: Sometimes it helps. ; Therapist: All right, so you have a fear that somebody is going to enter or break into where you live and you're staying up at night thinking about whether the door has been secured. ; Therapist: That's been troubling you. ; Therapist: Anything else? ; Patient: Sometimes if I'm leaving for work, I'll get to my car and I'll think I left the hair straight neuron and I'll think to myself, should I go back? ; Patient: I don't know what to do and I'll just like kind of debate whether or not I should just go double check. ; Patient: I'm just worried that if I left the straight neuron, something that would happen. ; Therapist: What do you think might happen? ; Patient: If I left the straight neuron, something, if I have like clothes or something and it's on a cloth, like that could burn or if it's, I just don't want anything. ; Patient: I don't want the place to burn down. ; Patient: That's what I'm nervous about. ; Therapist: When you leave, you're thinking about, it was a hair straightener? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're thinking about whether you unplugged it or not or turned it off or not? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: How long those thoughts go on for? ; Patient: Normally I think about it before I get into my car and I'll be like, well maybe I should just go just to make sure I unplugged it and I turned it off and then sometimes during the day I'll be at work and I can't focus just because I'm thinking about, I'll come back and I'll see my apartment burned down because I left the straightener plugged in. ; Therapist: So I remember with the door you're saying that you struggle with those thoughts but you don't get up and check the door. ; Therapist: Have you ever come back and checked to see if something was left to want? ; Patient: No, I haven't but I just, I think about it. ; Patient: Like what if I did leave it on or plugged in? ; Therapist: So you're worried, anxious? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Afraid? ; Patient: Yeah, definitely, all afraid. ; Therapist: And how often does this happen, like the cycle of thoughts? ; Patient: Probably throughout the day. ; Therapist: So every day? ; Patient: Every day, yeah. ; Therapist: And how long has this been going on? ; Patient: Ever since I moved I guess into the apartment, so about I guess a year. ; Therapist: So this has been going on for a year?

; Patient: The main thing is I'm just sleeping all the time. ; Patient: I'm really tired. ; Patient: You know, I'm tired when I have to go to work and then I go home and I just sleep a lot and I think it's abnormal. ; Patient: I haven't been eating as much lately. ; Patient: I've lost a bit of weight and it's just affecting my life so I just want to come in. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you have excessive sleep. ; Therapist: You feel like what is excessive sleep? ; Patient: Like just hours. ; Patient: I'll get home from work and I'll take a three-hour nap and then I'll wake up and do something that I enjoy but then it will be bedtime again and I'll be ready for bed even though I took a nap and I'll sleep in at any chance I can. ; Patient: I don't wake up early or anything. ; Therapist: And you mentioned your appetite as well. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I just, I don't know if it's just because I'm sleeping so much I'm not eating but I just like when I wake up it's not like, well I'm hungry, nothing. ; Patient: Like I just. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How long have these symptoms been present? ; Patient: I mean I would say I've noticed it in the last two weeks or so. ; Therapist: Over the last two weeks? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I've noticed that it's been getting worse. ; Therapist: Out of, I'd say one week, how many days do you have these symptoms? ; Patient: Probably every day. ; Therapist: Every day? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: All right, so I'm going to ask you some other questions related to this, okay? ; Therapist: Just provide me the best answer you can. ; Therapist: In the last two weeks have you found yourself depressed, sad, hopeless, anything like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: Not really. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Have you lost interest in activities that used to be fun for you? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No, I mean I still like all the things I did, like all my hobbies, I like hanging out with friends and stuff. ; Patient: Sometimes it's hard for me to remember to make plans with people and I just end up sleeping instead, but I genuinely enjoy it still. ; Patient: I'd like to go and see people do those things. ; Therapist: Do you ever feel agitated in terms of movement, like you can't stop moving or find yourself trying to resist moving? ; Patient: I guess. ; Patient: I guess like not so much I can't stop moving, but I do try to like stop. ; Patient: Yeah, I guess I do try to like stop myself from fidgeting. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's been happening? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any changes in terms of your level of energy? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean like I said I'm tired all the time. ; Patient: Sometimes I just can't get up and late to work just because I haven't had the energy to get up and stop sleeping and wake up. ; Therapist: Alright, so the excessive sleep has affected your level of energy? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about any type of feeling of worthlessness or anything like that? ; Patient: I mean I guess yeah, I mean I'm not, it sounds harsh, but I'm not really a valuable person really. ; Patient: I don't have a very important job or anything. ; Patient: No one really depends on me. ; Therapist: You don't feel yourself as valuable? ; Patient: I mean no, not really, but it is what it is. ; Therapist: How long have you felt this way? ; Patient: You know for a while, you know, and you know when you don't contribute very much. ; Patient: So it is what it is. ; Therapist: How about your concentration? ; Therapist: Have you found any changes there in your ability to concentrate? ; Patient: At work, yes, definitely. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Because I'll be tired and yawning and even when it comes to like outside of work I guess I'll forget to make plans with friends or forget, I don't know, little things, just little things that I do forget a lot and it's hard for me to pay attention to movies. ; Patient: I don't know if it's because I'm tired or not, like I just... ; Therapist: Do you have trouble focusing? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you ever have any thoughts of death or dying? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: You mentioned that these symptoms have been causing problems at work. ; Therapist: Any other areas where they've been causing you trouble, like limiting your functioning? ; Patient: You mean like, like social life? ; Therapist: Social life, relationships, life at home. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean I live on my own and you know like sleeping all the time, like I don't see anyone else and you know it's hard to meet new people if I was looking for a relationship. ; Patient: Yeah, I would say it affects it because I'm not like putting myself out there or anything and you know I forget or I'll sleep instead of making plans with friends on a Friday night so that can't be good. ; Therapist: How about substances? ; Therapist: Do you use any alcohol or drugs? ; Therapist: You know like that? ; Patient: No, I mean I'll drink socially but I haven't really. ; Patient: Done that. ; Therapist: How about medical conditions? ; Patient: None. ; Therapist: None? ; Therapist: Do you ever see or hear things that other people can't see or hear? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Have you ever had that happen? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a period in your life where you're having it now where you're extremely happy and have a lot of energy? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Has that ever happened? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Alright, Sherry. ; Therapist: I'm going to refer you to see a counselor. ; Therapist: I'll just schedule it in so you can see them in the next couple days if that works for you. ; Patient: Yeah, that works fine. ; Therapist: That works fine. ; Therapist: I appreciate you answering these questions. ; Therapist: This has been helpful. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Jessica, how you doing today? ; Patient: I'm okay. ; Therapist: You're okay? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: I understand you've been having some difficulty with some symptoms lately. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Tell me about that. ; Patient: Well, I've been having a lot of anxiety. ; Patient: Just been stressed out lately. ; Patient: Irritable. ; Patient: You name it, I have it. ; Patient: The thing that's been troubling me the most though are these memories that don't seem to go away. ; Patient: No matter what I do, I just keep remembering this event and it's really taken a toll on me. ; Therapist: So you're having anxiety and a lot of other symptoms and you're having intrusive memories. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about the event? ; Patient: Well, I was in a car accident a couple months ago and it was a pretty bad accident but I was okay. ; Patient: I was injured. ; Patient: My car was messed up really bad. ; Patient: The driver of the other car, I think they were injured pretty bad, more severe than I was. ; Patient: And I just can't seem to get that accident out of my mind. ; Therapist: Does it keep replaying that accident? ; Patient: Yes, over and over. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about how you're experiencing that? ; Patient: Well, I could be just in the kitchen making a pot of coffee and all of a sudden I'm back there in the accident. ; Patient: I'm back in the car with the airbags deployed and sirens coming from a distance. ; Patient: I try to shake that feeling and I just can't. ; Patient: And that just overwhelms me so much that I can't do anything. ; Patient: I just have to go and sit down and I'm stuck in the house just scared to do anything. ; Therapist: So these times when you're reliving the accident, does something trigger that or does that happen just on its own? ; Patient: Sometimes things trigger it and sometimes they just come out of nowhere. ; Patient: I could be watching a movie and there's a bad car accident and I start thinking about it or I could be just doing nothing and the memories, they just come back full force. ; Therapist: So this has been clearly causing you distress. ; Patient: A lot. ; Therapist: Has it been interfering at all with relationships? ; Patient: Well, yes, I would say. ; Patient: I haven't been able to go out with my friends. ; Patient: I just don't want to do anything. ; Patient: My friends are always trying to get me to go out and get things off of my mind and I just don't have a desire to. ; Patient: I don't really want to be around anyone. ; Therapist: Do you find that your mood is irritable or any anger at first? ; Patient: All the time. ; Therapist: That happens frequently? ; Patient: Yeah, I'm on edge a lot. ; Therapist: Do you feel like your behavior has become reckless, like taking more chances? ; Patient: Somewhat. ; Therapist: Somewhat? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about your memory of the accident? ; Therapist: Is it constant or does your memory change, like you lose some of that memory? ; Patient: Well, there are times when, where it's as clear as a bell and then other times people ask me details about the accident and I can't remember a thing. ; Therapist: You can't remember any of it? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: So the memory kind of comes and goes. ; Patient: It does, yes. ; Therapist: Who do you hold responsible for the accident? ; Patient: Well, everybody tells me that I shouldn't but I hold myself responsible for it. ; Patient: I mean, I try to go in a different way, home from work one day. ; Patient: It was a way that I've never gone before and, you know, somebody cut me off and I slammed into them but if I didn't go that way, I would have never gotten into the car accident. ; Therapist: Did the other driver get a ticket from the accident? ; Patient: I think he did. ; Patient: I think he got a ticket for reckless driving or failure to yield or something but, I mean, ; Patient: if I wasn't on that road, then neither of us would have been in the accident. ; Therapist: So you still blame yourself? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about your emotional state? ; Therapist: Since these symptoms have started, has it been mostly unhappy or down, neutral, anytime when you're happy? ; Patient: No, nothing seems to make me happy anymore. ; Patient: I'm just always depressed. ; Therapist: Your mood's always down. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about with driving? ; Therapist: Like, so have you been avoiding driving or have you driven since the accident? ; Patient: I have but I don't if I don't have to. ; Patient: Like, I definitely avoid going places like if I'm making dinner and I'm missing an ingredient, then I'll just go without it before driving to the market. ; Patient: I just I don't want to be behind the wheel of a car. ; Therapist: So you're avoiding it but you have driven. ; Patient: I have. ; Therapist: Tell me about the experience when you go to drive. ; Patient: Oh, boy. ; Patient: So I have to almost prepare myself hours in advance because it's so hard for me to get out the house. ; Therapist: In terms of anxiety or what's going on? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: I'm just having like knots in my stomach and, you know, shortness of breath. ; Patient: My chest is pounding. ; Patient: I'm just fearful. ; Patient: Just it's a lot. ; Patient: It's very overwhelming. ; Therapist: It's very stressful. ; Patient: It is. ; Therapist: Do you find that when you are driving that you are more aware of what other cars are doing and what you're doing in your car? ; Patient: Yeah, probably more so now than ever. ; Patient: I'm just always looking out, making sure that I don't cause another car accident. ; Patient: I'm driving slower. ; Patient: I'm, you know, I'm waiting longer to switch lanes. ; Patient: It's just, yeah, definitely. ; Therapist: You're more aware of your surroundings. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Therapist: So when something surprises us, there's a natural response or startled. ; Therapist: This is called a startled response. ; Therapist: And everybody has that. ; Therapist: Have you noticed that that's changed for you since these symptoms have started? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How's it changed? ; Patient: Anything. ; Patient: Everything startles me anymore. ; Patient: The doorbell ringing, the phone ringing, just, you know, somebody getting up to move their chair. ; Patient: Any little sound that just has me like looking over my shoulder to see what's going on. ; Therapist: And you find yourself jumping? ; Patient: Yeah, a lot. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How about your ability to concentrate? ; Therapist: Has that changed at all? ; Patient: It has. ; Patient: It decreased a lot. ; Patient: I haven't really been able to concentrate on anything. ; Patient: I have things all over my house where I've started things and moved on to something else because I can't concentrate on one thing. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about sleeping? ; Therapist: How are you doing with sleep? ; Patient: Not too good. ; Patient: I'm not getting a lot of sleep at all these days. ; Patient: I'm up all hours of the night sometimes. ; Patient: I just wake up for no reason. ; Patient: Sometimes I'll wake up out of a dream just scared. ; Patient: I'm just... I'm not sleeping well at all. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So a lot of challenges with sleep. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Do you use any drugs or alcohol? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: How about medical problems? ; Patient: Never. ; Therapist: I like that. ; Therapist: Are there times from when these symptoms started when you feel kind of separated from your own body? ; Therapist: Like it's like an unreal experience? ; Patient: I've had a couple experiences like that. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about those? ; Patient: Well, there was one time I was at work and we were sitting in the cafeteria and just all of a sudden everything seemed to start going in slow motion. ; Patient: And I could hear people talking but it sounded very slow. ; Patient: It was like, it's hard to describe but I could see everything but it just wasn't moving at a normal pace. ; Patient: I kind of felt like I was watching a movie almost. ; Patient: And that's happened at least two or three times. ; Patient: And I didn't really understand what was going on. ; Patient: A friend of mine told me, she said that I was kind of like spaced out and she was like snapping her fingers in front of my face and I could see her but I couldn't really hear what was going on. ; Patient: And then I just like snapped out of it. ; Patient: And everybody was sitting around staring at me and they were talking about what was going on and I had no idea what was happening. ; Patient: But it was very embarrassing. ; Patient: They were watching me like I was a movie. ; Therapist: This has happened a few times? ; Patient: Yeah, in a couple different locations. ; Patient: One time I was at work, one time I was at school and these things just happened out of the blue. ; Therapist: How about a time when you felt like the world became unreal? ; Therapist: So you're not detached from your body but the world becomes unreal or dreamlike or distorted. ; Therapist: Have you ever had that happen? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: It's more being separated from your body, more that feeling? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you mentioned the time slowing down? ; Patient: Yeah, very, like slow motion. ; Therapist: Slow motion? ; Patient: Yeah, like you were watching a movie in slow motion. ; Patient: The sound and everything was just dragging. ; Therapist: Jessica, I'm going to get you in to see a counselor here if you're okay with that. ; Patient: Yes, I think that would be okay. ; Therapist: I appreciate you taking the time to explain these symptoms. ; Therapist: I know they're distressing for you and for taking the time to answer my questions. ; Therapist: It's been helpful for me to help figure out what's going on and help manage your care. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Patient: I appreciate your help. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Glad you came in today. ; Therapist: How's it going today for you? ; Patient: Um, I'm just kind of the same as it's been for the last few months. ; Patient: Um, not getting any better. ; Patient: Still feeling pretty down. ; Therapist: Well, from last week when we talked, I mean, kind of talk about your situation, getting injured on the job, and if we're losing your job, you kind of get in the way you didn't want to do anything, and sleeping a lot. ; Therapist: And then your wife left you and took the kids. ; Therapist: I just went very hard on you. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And so, when I had you take that inventory, um, answering all those questions, I kind of scored that, and in fact do have pretty severe depression. ; Therapist: So... Yeah. ; Patient: I think I already knew that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Not a surprise. ; Patient: I guess it's nice to get validation on that. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So what I thought we might do today, if it's okay with you, is, um, there's a therapy I'd like to try with you to kind of address your depression. ; Therapist: It's called cognitive behavioral therapy. ; Therapist: I don't know if you've ever heard of that. ; Patient: I think I may have heard the name before. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'll describe it a little bit to you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So if we can kind of work on that therapy to kind of help your depression, and I'm thinking this might impact a lot of areas in your life, getting to work and relationships and stuff, so you kind of focus on the depression right now. ; Therapist: And then I'd like to, after I've talked about that and some situations where you're feeling depressed, if we can... ; Therapist: I want to give you some tools maybe to take home this week to kind of talk about the situations of your depression and thoughts and feelings and stuff, and then so next week we can have some concrete stuff to think about. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that sound okay with you that we do that today? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I don't want to try anything, so... ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Well, that's a big part of it. ; Therapist: Your willingness to try is a big key part in cognitive behavioral therapy because you're willing to do the work to get better. ; Therapist: So... Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Let me tell you a little bit about the cognitive behavioral therapy. ; Therapist: Sometimes it's called CET, just those initials. ; Therapist: And it takes an individual, a situation that's happening with an individual, a thought that automatically comes into the mind of that individual, how it makes them feel, and then how they respond because of that feeling. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Therapist: So we'll take an example, like, tell me about the last time that you were feeling depressed. ; Patient: Uh, I'd say probably this morning. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What was going on this morning? ; Patient: You know, I just woke up. ; Patient: I think it was like 10 o'clock or so and just couldn't get out of bed. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you woke up and couldn't get out of bed. ; Therapist: What's the first thought that came into your mind? ; Patient: Um, I think at first I thought, you know, why would I get out of bed? ; Patient: There's no reason for me to get out of bed. ; Patient: I mean, my wife's calling. ; Patient: Don't really have many friends anymore. ; Patient: Don't have a job. ; Patient: You know, what's the point of getting out of bed this morning? ; Therapist: How'd that make you feel about yourself? ; Patient: Worthless, I guess. ; Patient: I mean, like, I don't really even matter. ; Patient: I just made me feel really, really bad and worthless. ; Therapist: Because of that feeling, what would you do? ; Therapist: Were you able to get out of bed or just stayed in bed? ; Patient: Stayed in bed until I came here. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I was in bed most of the day. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm going to congratulate you for getting out of bed and coming here today. ; Therapist: That's a big step. ; Therapist: I'm glad you're here. ; Patient: Me too. ; Therapist: Do you often have those feelings when you're a person of worthlessness? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I'd say most of the time. ; Patient: That's how I feel. ; Patient: That's kind of what causes it, I think. ; Therapist: And typically, is your response to that feeling stay in bed or... ; Patient: I mean, if I'm... Emogalizes you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, if I'm in bed at the time, then yeah, I won't get out. ; Patient: I mean, sometimes I'll be on the couch and start thinking and feeling like that and then I'll just... ; Patient: I won't move. ; Patient: Just kind of just... lay there. ; Therapist: Let me ask you, Tommy. ; Therapist: Can you remember a time when you weren't depressed? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, before the accident worked. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Lots of times. ; Patient: And spending time with my kids. ; Therapist: Tell me a little bit about those times. ; Therapist: When you can remember before the accident, when you were experiencing some depression. ; Patient: Um... I mean, I'd be laying in bed in the morning. ; Patient: My kids would run, jump, and wake me up and kind of irritate me a little bit. ; Patient: But, I mean, I love having them do that. ; Patient: Get up and make pancakes and have a big long breakfast. ; Patient: And then, if it was on the weekend, then we'd go do something fun like go to the park or go see a movie or something like that. ; Therapist: Can you remember how you felt back then? ; Therapist: How'd you feel when those activities were going on? ; Patient: I just felt good. ; Patient: I just... I mean, I felt loved by my kids and I loved them. ; Patient: It was just great. ; Patient: I just felt good. ; Therapist: Did it kind of feel like the opposite of worthless? ; Therapist: I mean, they needed you and you felt good and you felt loved and you felt engaged in their life. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It was the opposite of what I feel now. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So, sometime when you have these worthless feelings and not being able to get out of bed, do you think it would help you to think about times when you felt pretty good about yourself? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, I guess I've never tried that before. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I don't know if it'll work. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: I'd be willing to try. ; Therapist: I'd be kind of willing to try that. ; Therapist: So, maybe when you're feeling down, can't get off the couch, can't get out of bed. ; Therapist: I think of some times when it was different for you. ; Therapist: You were in a different situation. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: But, and you certainly didn't feel this way. ; Therapist: You didn't feel this way because you felt loved, engaged. ; Therapist: Important part of you. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's fun. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What about when you were working? ; Therapist: How did you feel about yourself at work? ; Patient: Well, I worked in a factory and we made car parts and stuff and I don't know. ; Patient: I felt like I was doing something. ; Patient: I mean, I was making parts that were going to go in a car, which then someone would use to drive to their job or drive their families. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: So, I felt like I was doing something. ; Patient: Like, I had a purpose. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Then the accident happened and I lost that. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: And that's when I started to feel worthless. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: I'm glad you can still feel or remember some times when you felt that you did have a purpose and you felt loved and valued. ; Therapist: And I know with depression, it's hard to get up and get out of bed. ; Therapist: That's some of the, and a lot of people will say, you know, if I, I'm going to wait until I feel better and then I'm going to get up and I'm going to get out of bed and then I'm going to do. ; Therapist: A lot of times with depression, what you actually have to do, you have to get up out of bed and do something and then you feel better. ; Therapist: And I know it's kind of hard to do that with these feelings that you're feeling right now. ; Patient: Yeah, but I mean, I think that makes sense. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: You said? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And sometimes it's helpful to have something scheduled or planned. ; Therapist: Right now in your, in your life, tell me some things that you might enjoy doing. ; Therapist: Might, could think about be worth getting out of bed in order to do. ; Patient: Um, I would say seeing my wife and kids, but I don't know if that's really an option right now. ; Patient: Um, I always loved fishing. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah, I always, always enjoyed doing that. ; Therapist: When was the last time you went fishing? ; Patient: Uh, it was a long time ago. ; Patient: I mean, right before the accident happened. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Are you recovered enough from the accident in which you could go fishing? ; Therapist: Is that a reality? ; Therapist: Is that something that you could do? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I think I could. ; Patient: Okay, great. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So fishing is something that, that would be an important. ; Therapist: Are there any other activities or meeting with people? ; Therapist: And those remind me, is your wife out of town and your kids consider it a little bit more difficult to maybe see them on a regular basis? ; Patient: Yeah, they're out of town. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Other activities besides fishing that you might enjoy doing or being with people or things you enjoy doing or need pleasure in life? ; Patient: I mean, I used to get together with my buddies and we usually had like a cookout or something at somebody's house and watch football or sit around and talk. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Um, yeah, we always, I mean, we all had family so as kind of, we'd all get together and just kind of get away for a little bit. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: That sounds fun. ; Therapist: Is that something that might be able to be planned or you might be able to have a get together with at least one if it's not the whole group, you know, one or two of your old buddies? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I think, I think we could do that. ; Patient: I mean, I just hadn't talked to them forever. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Patient: I mean, when I, after the accident, since I've been feeling so down, I haven't really made any effort with them at all and they kind of tried at first but then I just never followed up with any of them. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: But I mean, I guess I might be willing to try. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's another good suggestion. ; Therapist: As far as what do, is there an activity you should do even by yourself, either playing an instrument or listen to music or exercising or watching movies or something that gives you pleasure that you don't necessarily need, I mean, fishing is a good one. ; Therapist: I know you don't really need anybody else for but I'm just thinking in case your buddies were busy, I'm thinking of another thing you might want to do that brings you pleasure or something. ; Patient: I mean, working out was always something that I did. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And how did that make you feel when you worked out? ; Patient: Well, during the workout, I got tired. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: I always felt really good afterwards. ; Patient: Afterwards, okay. ; Patient: Yeah, like I had done something. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: I was like, I need to come up with something. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: So, yeah, working out is definitely something I used to do a lot, get a lot out of. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Now, those are some good suggestions of things that you might want. ; Therapist: It's, you probably need to start out slow in scheduling some things but it's nice to have, if you can, something on your agenda every day in order for you to get out of bed for. ; Therapist: It might be a workout. ; Therapist: It might be going fishing. ; Therapist: It might be calling a buddy to schedule something or it might be hanging out with a friend. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, Tommy, I'd like your goal this next week and you can write it on this piece of paper right here, kind of journal about it. ; Therapist: You know, put the date and go ahead and put, I'd like you to have some, you can first talk about maybe when you're in bed and can't get out. ; Therapist: You can write about your thought, the automatic thought that's coming into your mind, you know. ; Therapist: I'm in bed and the automatic thought is? ; Patient: There's no reason for me to get out of bed. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: No reason to get out of bed. ; Therapist: And then you use the word worthless, whatever that automatic thought that comes in your mind, write that down. ; Therapist: And then write down how that makes you feel. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And then you mentioned often your action or your response to that feeling is just to stay in bed. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So, I'd like for you to go ahead and log those emotions when those situations occur, you know, the situation, the thought, the emotion and your reaction to it. ; Therapist: But another thing I'd like for you to do is if you can schedule one event a day, alright, that you would enjoy doing. ; Therapist: And it could be a phone call, it doesn't have to be getting that. ; Therapist: And give yourself a break. ; Therapist: Know that this is going to be difficult and you're going to start out slow and you're going to work up to it. ; Therapist: But just one event a day. ; Therapist: I want you to log as well, you know, where there is. ; Therapist: I called my kids or I called my buddy to schedule something or I went to work out. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: And I also would like for you to write down how you felt about yourself after you did that. ; Therapist: After the phone call, how you felt about yourself. ; Therapist: After the workout, how it made you feel. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: After you got together with your buddies. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So go ahead and document this progression and then log the different activities that's here. ; Therapist: And then we'll talk about it next week. ; Therapist: And we can talk about what's, you know, these automatic thoughts and then any of these activities. ; Therapist: And if any of these activities are actually helping. ; Therapist: It might take a while, Tommy. ; Therapist: You have to be patient with the process, be patient with yourself and other people. ; Therapist: I mean you mentioned a while ago that your buddies, you know, they tried connecting with you and it was maybe difficult. ; Therapist: And they'll probably be glad that you're wanting to reengage with them. ; Therapist: So that might be an encouragement to you as well. ; Therapist: So is this something that you can work on this week? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Does it feel overwhelming or? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I mean I feel good about that. ; Patient: I mean it's just going to be different. ; Patient: But like I said I'm willing to try whatever I need to right now. ; Therapist: I think that's a good part of this, the willingness to try. ; Therapist: And the patience that's going to be the process and take time. ; Therapist: But we'll go through this step at a time and we can talk about it and see what's working and what's not working. ; Therapist: And we can make changes on it. ; Therapist: But I think this CBT really helps you think about, you know, what's going on and why am I feeling this way. ; Therapist: You know, identifying the thoughts in your mind and why I might be thinking of this and why I'm reacting because of this. ; Therapist: And you might even rate your emotion and say, yesterday I felt, you know, my feeling of worthlessness on a scale from 1 to 100 was 90. ; Therapist: But today it's actually 80. ; Therapist: And maybe next week it might be 70. ; Therapist: So if you want to add a particular number to associate your, the association with that feeling of worthlessness, if you want to kind of put a value on it. ; Therapist: And we can kind of see how that adjusts with time. ; Therapist: That might be helpful. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: That sounds like it would be helpful. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: We'll talk about that next time. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Thank you.",

It's the way I get things. ; Patient: It's the only way I get things. ; Patient: It's the only way I know how to be. ; Patient: I come out one of two ways. ; Patient: I come out either full throttle, just full tilt. ; Patient: Just come at them and just do it that way. ; Patient: Or I don't do anything at all. ; Patient: So it's like I'm one way and it's not good enough. ; Patient: And I'm the other way and it's not good enough. ; Therapist: So it's like damned if you do and damned if you don't. ; Patient: Damned if I do, damned if I don't. ; Patient: If I go one way at everybody, it doesn't seem to make a difference one way or the other. ; Patient: And then if I'm just quiet and just falling with the crowd, it doesn't matter either. ; Therapist: It sounds like it feels like you only have two choices. ; Therapist: You can either approach the situation kind of on the attack with both guns blazing. ; Patient: That's a good way to describe it. ; Patient: Both guns blazing. ; Therapist: Or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way. ; Therapist: Of those two, which feels better or which feels worse? ; Patient: The both guns blazing always feels better. ; Patient: Because if I go at somebody with full force and hit them over the head and just go at them, even if they turn away, it doesn't really matter. ; Patient: Because I've already said my piece and said what I had to say. ; Patient: But if I don't say anything and I just sit back and don't do anything, then it just gets me as angry as the both guns blazing. ; Patient: So it just eats me up. ; Patient: But it eats me up in here and I get even angrier than if I just blurt it all out and get it all out. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Yeah, I can imagine that. ; Therapist: At least if you're going in there with both guns blazing, there's a way in which you can kind of feel okay about yourself in some way, even though you're not getting your needs met. ; Therapist: But somehow they're sort of giving in. ; Therapist: It's like you're giving away part of yourself in some way. ; Therapist: It seems to me that the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met right now. ; Therapist: You sort of desperately need something. ; Patient: There's no middle ground. ; Therapist: There's no middle ground. ; Therapist: So I'm not sure exactly what that middle ground is right now, but I'm willing to work with you to really work on discovering what that middle ground is. ; Therapist: Does that seem worthwhile? ; Patient: I have to. ; Patient: I have to find a middle ground. ; Therapist: What are you feeling right now? ; Patient: Just it bothers me. ; Patient: I can't go one way or the other. ; Patient: I try to do one thing and I can't do it. ; Patient: I try to do it the other way. ; Patient: I can't do it. ; Patient: I'm just stuck. ; Therapist: There's a real kind of sadness there and maybe a hopelessness. ; Patient: I don't know what to do. ; Patient: It feels like there's nothing I can do. ; Patient: There's just no good way of doing it. ; Patient: It almost feels like what's the point? ; Therapist: Yeah. You look at me, in the sense of what's going on for you ; Therapist: It's almost as if you're asking for something. ; Patient: I need something. ; Patient: I can't get it myself. ; Therapist: You know, I hear that. I hear that. ; Therapist: I hear your desperation and I hear your sadness and your pain and your hopelessness. ; Therapist: I'll do my best to help you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hello, Kathy. ; Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You okay? ; Therapist: I know when you spoke last time, you had some goals that you want to talk about this time. ; Therapist: Are you ready to do that? ; Patient: I need to, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Therapist: What do you have in mind? ; Patient: I just keep thinking about losing this weight and I just, I really want to do it. ; Patient: I just can't get there and I don't know why. ; Therapist: So you're frustrated. ; Patient: It's so ridiculous. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Frustrated trying to lose the weight. ; Therapist: Now you had said before that you had a specific number of pounds in mind, specific amount of weight to lose. ; Therapist: Do you still have that in mind? ; Patient: I would like 20 pounds. ; Therapist: 20 pounds. ; Patient: I mean, I would like more, but I've tried to do more in the past and I don't even get past a couple of days. ; Patient: So if I can do 20, that would be great. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: What have you tried before and what do you think got in the way? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I guess it wasn't convenient. ; Patient: I want to do it and it means a lot for me and my family. ; Patient: I think I'd be a lot healthier. ; Therapist: It's important to you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: But just like something always gets in the way, you know, and then I lose focus. ; Patient: I'm not very good at staying focused on stuff like that anyway. ; Patient: So. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So loss of focus. ; Therapist: So you start trying to lose the weight and your focus gets disrupted. ; Patient: And I forget and then I make, you know, spaghetti casserole for six people and then I eat a lot of it and that's carbs and cheese and fat. ; Patient: And then I, you know, we'll eat what my kids don't eat. ; Patient: And then it's just like, I forget that I'm supposed to be making healthy choices. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you know how to lose weight and you know you can lose weight, but your focus is a little off when you're trying and that's causing the problem. ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Could we break that goal of losing 20 pounds down into smaller units like say five pounds? ; Patient: Do you think, well maybe. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Um, cause I've never, I always just keep like the chunk of weight, you know, ahead of me. ; Patient: I don't break it into smaller income. ; Patient: It's not my work. ; Patient: I mean, I don't know how I'd have to stay on top of it though. ; Patient: Weigh myself every day. ; Therapist: Is that something you can do? ; Patient: I'm so busy. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: Or once a week. ; Patient: I probably do once a week. ; Patient: Put a sticky note somewhere or something. ; Patient: You know, maybe. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I want to try. ; Patient: I'm going to say yes cause I want to try it. ; Therapist: So you mentioned the loss of focus is one problem. ; Therapist: How about motivation? ; Therapist: Do you feel motivated to move through all those steps like five pounds and five pounds and so on? ; Patient: Right now? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: I think I would need something to keep me going, you know, week to week. ; Therapist: A little bit of something extra to help you stay motivated. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Sometimes when your kid does their homework early and you can give them a special treat for dessert, that helps keep it going. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So some sort of activity or item that you enjoy that you could reserve for when you reach that goal of say the first five pounds. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I would love, I mean, I'm just, I've been so embarrassed, you know, lately. ; Patient: So I feel like I just, if I can find something that keeps me motivated, that would be great. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do you have a activity or item in mind that we could put in place as something you could reward yourself with? ; Patient: Like after the first five pounds? ; Therapist: Well, there's a few ways we could do it. ; Therapist: We could do that. ; Therapist: So you reach five pounds and then you can give yourself that reward. ; Therapist: Or it could be for something you do every day if that day you're successful in eating the way you want to eat. ; Therapist: What do you think would motivate you more? ; Patient: Maybe something every day? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: So I remember, you know, I just get so distracted by other stuff. ; Patient: There was something every day that maybe I put out almost like a goal at the end of the day or something. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: You know, if I made the right choices. ; Therapist: Yeah, so you know each and every day as you're trying to lose weight, you're aware when that day comes to a close if you had a successful day or a less than successful day. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: If you had a successful day, then you could engage in an activity or receive an item that we work out in advance that you know would motivate you. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: And that could be, you know, maybe watching like a favorite TV show. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: You know, because I don't watch TV at night because I'm so busy, you know, cleaning up and everything. ; Patient: Maybe I could just take some time for myself because I did something good. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: You know, and just watch a TV show. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So let's do that. ; Therapist: On a day, you know, toward the evening when you know you have had a successful day, by what time would you know in the evening? ; Patient: Probably as I'm preparing dinner. ; Patient: If I prepare a good dinner or if I prepare fun food for my kids but I don't eat it, like chicken nuggets and french fries and stuff, I would know, you know, maybe by like six or seven. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Let's say seven. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So by seven p.m. ; Therapist: at that point, in terms of the day being successful or less than successful, you know. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: By seven p.m. ; Therapist: you're aware. ; Therapist: And at that point, if you have met your goal, then you have a TV show that you maybe have recorded on the TV or something you would watch. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And if you were not as successful, you would. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So it'd be like something to keep you motivated throughout the day because you really want to watch that show. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: It'd be a lot of fun. ; Therapist: You think that structure, that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation to have successful days through this process? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I'm not a fan of it, honestly, but it would probably beat the way I feel right now. ; Patient: Anything's kind of better than carrying this, this frustration around. ; Patient: So I'm willing to try anything and I'll try to remember. ; Patient: Like I said, I'll write it down, you know, have it in the kitchen, have it on a note at seven p.m. ; Patient: You know, how did I do today? ; Therapist: Yeah, this is something you could also track, right? ; Therapist: You could write down days that were successful, days that were less than successful, and we could look at if there's any patterns. ; Therapist: Maybe weekends are harder, weekends are easier, you know, or something where we can identify days that have maybe more triggers or where you're less motivated. ; Patient: Yeah, I didn't think about that because, right, every day would be different. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: There's a potential for every day to be different with what you're exposed to and what temptations in terms of different foods or what your schedule is like. ; Therapist: Maybe if you're busier, it's easier. ; Therapist: So we can look at those different patterns and we can add levels to this plan. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But for now, we'll go with the TV show that you'll watch sometime after seven. ; Therapist: So at seven, you'll evaluate how you did, and then sometime after that, watch the show. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: That's like a plan? ; Patient: So that's leading up to the five pounds. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: That's just day by day. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Take this in five pound increments four times to get to your goal of 20 pounds. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Does that sound good? ; Patient: So far so good, yeah. ; Therapist: We'll give that a shot and we'll take a look at the pattern that emerges. ; Therapist: So record everything, right? ; Therapist: So write everything down. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So you'll see around seven is a good time when you know what kind of day you had. ; Therapist: Write down kind of what happened that day and whether you had success or not and bring that in. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I'll see you again in a week. ; Therapist: So that'll give you seven days to work with. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we'll look at that log of events and we'll reevaluate each week. ; Patient: So I could start tonight? ; Therapist: Start tonight. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So we'll give that a shot and I'll see you in a week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Thanks. ; Therapist: Thanks, Kathy.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, Ms. ; Therapist: Watson. ; Patient: Nice to see you again, Dr. Goldblum. ; Therapist: I'm glad you came back in. ; Therapist: I've got the results now of the blood work that we did after your checkup. ; Therapist: Before we go over any of that, I really wanted to find out from you how things are going and what you're concerned about. ; Patient: Well, I'm curious about them because I haven't been very well, right? ; Patient: I haven't been feeling very well. ; Patient: Last week I threw up some blood. ; Therapist: Is that the first time that's happened? ; Patient: Yeah, the first time. ; Patient: I threw up blood last week and then again yesterday. ; Patient: There's something bad going on. ; Patient: I know there's something bad going on. ; Therapist: What do you think is going on? ; Patient: Well, cancer, right? ; Patient: I think I probably have cancer. ; Patient: I'm not doing very well. ; Patient: I'm just not doing very well. ; Therapist: Look, let's try to figure some of this out, okay? ; Therapist: When you said you were throwing up blood, were you throwing up bright red blood? ; Therapist: Was it little spots, big spots? ; Patient: It was almost filling the toilet. ; Patient: It wasn't that much. ; Patient: It was enough that I could see it in the toilet when I was throwing up. ; Therapist: Did you have any other symptoms? ; Patient: Well, I was feeling sick and I had headaches. ; Therapist: What time of day was this? ; Patient: I have headaches a lot throughout the day. ; Therapist: But the throwing up the blood? ; Patient: That was in the morning and then again the other time it was sort of later in the day. ; Patient: I also wake up in the middle of the night and I'm just covered in sweat. ; Patient: I know that's another cancer thing. ; Therapist: Well, look, I can understand why you're worried, all right? ; Therapist: Because throwing up blood is scary and waking up soaked in sweat in the middle of the night, that doesn't feel right either. ; Therapist: Let me ask you a couple of questions that might help explain things. ; Therapist: When did you have your last drink? ; Patient: Actually, just before I came here. ; Therapist: Okay, so that was earlier this morning. ; Therapist: What did you have? ; Patient: I had orange juice and I had some vodka in it. ; Patient: It's the only thing actually that like steadies me enough to get out the door. ; Patient: I don't go out that often, but you know. ; Therapist: So tell me how it helps you. ; Patient: It just steadies me. ; Patient: It steadies me. ; Patient: Like I'm, you know, I'm shaking all the time. ; Patient: I'm just like. ; Therapist: So over the course of a day, in order to steady yourself, in order to feel calmer, how many drinks do you end up having? ; Patient: Five? ; Patient: Maybe. ; Therapist: Singles or doubles? ; Patient: I don't measure. ; Patient: I think so. ; Therapist: Is it mainly vodka? ; Patient: Sometimes if I'm feeling really like my stomach is really upset, I'll drink cider. ; Patient: So that's cider or vodka. ; Therapist: And do you ever get that feeling in the morning that some people describe that they wake up feeling so edgy they need a drink to calm down? ; Patient: It's like the only thing that works for me. ; Patient: It's the only thing that works to. ; Therapist: So in the past week, do you think you've been drinking more? ; Patient: In the last week? ; Patient: Not so much. ; Patient: Maybe the last couple of weeks, maybe. ; Therapist: Has it been daily? ; Patient: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So the longest you've gone without a drink in the last month would be how long? ; Patient: I don't know, actually. ; Patient: I mean, I don't know. ; Patient: I've got, you know, I've got a lot going on, right? ; Patient: So my sister is in Boston. ; Patient: She's got cancer. ; Patient: And I know, like, I should be calling her, and I can't do that. ; Patient: My mom is really sick, and she's horrible. ; Patient: And I'm the only one who can go see her. ; Patient: And I go see my mother, and she just yells and screams at me. ; Patient: And she's got emphysema. ; Patient: And it's just... ; Therapist: And so for all of those things, the alcohol helps? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And does it ever happen, sort of by the end of the day, that you have trouble the next day remembering what happened? ; Patient: I guess. ; Patient: I mean, you know, my days don't differ that much. ; Patient: But I, you know, I'll fall asleep in front of the television, and then... ; Patient: I'm not seeing lots of people. ; Patient: So I, you know, there's not big events in my life that I would be remembering. ; Patient: I just, you know, and especially now that I'm feeling so not well, that I... ; Patient: Yeah, there's not much that I would have to remember. ; Therapist: Have you tried at all to cut down on your drinking? ; Patient: I did. ; Patient: You know, I had a boyfriend who, you know, was sort of casual coming over. ; Patient: And he basically said he couldn't be with me anymore because I drank too much. ; Patient: And so I tried. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I tried. ; Therapist: It's hard. ; Patient: Well, yeah. ; Patient: And then he laughed. ; Patient: So who cares, right? ; Patient: I mean... ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Who cares? ; Therapist: But have you found yourself feeling guilty about the alcohol? ; Patient: I feel guilty about my sister. ; Patient: I feel guilty that I can't, like I just can't, I can't even call her. ; Patient: Like I can't, right? ; Patient: So if I could pull it together, then I could... ; Therapist: Because what I understand from what you're telling me is that the drinking helps meet a certain need for you in terms of trying to hold things together with all this stuff going on. ; Therapist: And it meets a need in terms of trying to keep you calmer. ; Therapist: But at the same time, it's getting you into trouble. ; Therapist: It's getting into trouble in terms of relationships. ; Therapist: But it's also the most likely explanation for why you've been throwing up blood. ; Patient: Is it? ; Therapist: Why the lab results that I've got are consistent with an amount of alcohol that's too much for your body to handle. ; Patient: Really? ; Therapist: Really. ; Patient: And that means, ideally, that we're going to work together to find a way to do something about it.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, this is Dr. Grande. ; Therapist: I hope you find this video useful. ; Therapist: If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel. ; Therapist: As always, thanks for watching. ; Therapist: How many times have you gone to work and made a mistake? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, I guess none technically, none that have been something I've gotten trouble for or anything like that. ; Patient: Sometimes it's hard to tell because you don't always hear from people afterwards. ; Patient: You can't really tell was it a mistake or not, but I guess none that have had any major consequences. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So none, but there might be a few small ones that you just never found out about. ; Therapist: So less than a tenth of a percent of the days you go in? ; Patient: Probably. ; Therapist: Very small. ; Patient: Yeah, really, really small. ; Therapist: So the probability of the statement that you're making being true is pretty low. ; Therapist: The statement, the thought rather, that I'm going to make a mistake. ; Therapist: Probably not supported by the evidence. ; Patient: Yeah, I guess that's true. ; Therapist: So the automatic thought is not accurate and not useful. ; Therapist: It's got a couple of strikes against it, but it is the thought you're having, so let's deal with it. ; Therapist: I'm going to make a mistake. ; Therapist: So what could you tell yourself as the first part of the adaptive response, which acknowledges that fear? ; Therapist: That's realistic, that acknowledges that fear of making a mistake. ; Patient: I guess everybody makes mistakes? ; Therapist: Everybody makes mistakes. ; Therapist: I could make a mistake today, but it's unlikely? ; Therapist: That also be accurate? ; Therapist: So everybody makes mistakes. ; Therapist: I could make a mistake, but it's probably not going to happen. ; Therapist: It's not that I'm going to make a mistake. ; Therapist: So you're going to have that automatic thought either way, likely for a while, until you start to apply these adaptive responses. ; Therapist: So this is what we're working on, is your response. ; Therapist: So everybody makes mistakes, I could make a mistake, but it's probably not going to happen. ; Therapist: And what could be the next part, which is realistic but also positive, that can help get you past the reaction of being late in the morning? ; Patient: I'm a good case worker and I need to do my job so I can help other people and it's going to be okay. ; Therapist: Okay, so there's a few elements in there. ; Therapist: It's going to be okay, I need to do my job, I help people, all those are true. ; Therapist: So applying, now even as you say this here with me, as you say it's going to be okay and I need to do my job. ; Therapist: What reaction are you having right now? ; Patient: I mean it feels a little better, it's hard to, you know, I still feel like it's dangerous, I might make a mistake, but I guess it helps a little bit. ; Therapist: Can you see yourself being able to, in the moment, and I realize this is difficult, but in the moment of having that automatic thought, having that worry come in, can you see yourself applying this self-talk? ; Patient: Yeah, I think I probably will because now it will be hard to have those thoughts and not think of you and think, okay, I need to calm myself down a little bit because we've been talking about it for so long. ; Therapist: And you've already used self-talk on your own before you even knew about these strategies. ; Patient: Yep, that's true. ; Patient: And it did help in the past. ; Therapist: A lot of the, or I should say some of the effectiveness of this is based on your ability in that moment to take a step back and follow the training. ; Therapist: Just like many professionals, professionals depend on their training to help them make the correct intervention, correct decision. ; Therapist: So think of this kind of like something you've learned in a training. ; Therapist: This is a self-talk, it's pre-packaged, it's ready to go. ; Therapist: You can even have it written down. ; Therapist: It doesn't have to be short, it can be like a paragraph or more if you wanted. ; Therapist: And it's a matter of following the protocol. ; Therapist: So you have the automatic thought, it's easy to descend into worry and fear. ; Therapist: You're just looking to grab a moment in there and apply this treatment, this strategy. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Therapist: Sometimes it's likely, well most of the time I think you would be able to do this, sometimes you probably won't. ; Therapist: And it's important in those moments to not get discouraged. ; Therapist: So you can have a self-talk for that too. ; Therapist: And like Dr. Groundy said, it was likely that once in a while I wouldn't be able to do this. ; Patient: Yeah, it's not going to work every time. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. ; Therapist: So it's the chaos of life, right, and the chaos of emotions that sometimes interfere. ; Therapist: The more times you have success, that seems to be tied with a better chance of improving and reduction of symptoms. ; Therapist: But allow yourself failures as well. ; Therapist: It's what I would expect from anybody trying to untangle all these feelings and thoughts. ; Therapist: There's not going to be a perfect connection between an automatic thought and applied self-talk. ; Therapist: So be easy on yourself as you try this. ; Patient: That makes sense because if you could just flip a switch, I would only have to have one therapy session. ; Therapist: It would be in good shape. ; Therapist: So it's a little more difficult than that. ; Therapist: But overall, these strategies are fairly straightforward, and you can definitely learn them, and you can definitely do them. ; Therapist: I want you to have that confidence. ; Therapist: It's normal to have mistakes occur, and to not always do it as you need to, or as you want to. ; Therapist: But in the end, overall, you should be able to apply them, and actually it will get easier in the future to develop your self-talk for different thoughts.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Tiffany, how you doing today? ; Patient: I'm alright. ; Therapist: You alright? ; Patient: I'm alright. ; Therapist: I understand you've been having some recent difficulties. ; Patient: The thing with the cops. ; Therapist: You had some involvement with the police? ; Patient: I was so blown out of proportion. ; Patient: Stupid neighbours were having a party. ; Patient: And I'm trying to be asleep. ; Patient: It's like 10-11, you know, I'm trying to wind down. They're having a party. ; Patient: I go over there, yell at the door. Yell through the door, yo, I'm trying to be asleep, bring it down some. ; Patient: No response. ; Patient: So, I let myself in, with a little force, but I let myself in. ; Patient: They're all up. ; Patient: I just confront who's ever there. ; Patient: Who's having this party? ; Patient: Everybody's just like, everybody's ignoring me. ; Patient: So, I just go over, take the stereo, open the window, throw it out the window. ; Patient: Then, there may have been people walking by. ; Patient: This woman swear she was walking by. ; Patient: Says, I almost, said, I almost hit her. ; Patient: But to me, she called the cops. ; Therapist: So, what story were you on? ; Patient: Maybe third floor. ; Therapist: Third floor. ; Therapist: So, you threw the stereo out the window and it landed on the ground? ; Patient: It did not. ; Patient: It was nowhere near that woman. ; Patient: She was way across the street, but she says, I almost hit her. ; Patient: So, whatever. ; Therapist: So, she called the? ; Patient: She called the police. ; Patient: Said, I was out of control. ; Patient: And then, the people from the party had a nerve to go down when the cops got there. ; Patient: And they agreed with her. ; Patient: They said, I came, they said, I broke him, but I just came in. ; Patient: But anyway, they said, I threw the stereo out. ; Patient: And then, the police are threatening to put me in jail and they're threatening to press charges. ; Patient: And now, it's just ugly, but it's blown out of proportion. ; Therapist: You feel it's blown out of proportion? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Has anything like this happened before? ; Patient: Not with the police or anything. ; Therapist: How about anything where you found your anger kind of strong? ; Patient: Well, maybe. ; Patient: There was the time it was my daughter. ; Patient: She's 16 years old. ; Patient: You know how teenagers are? ; Patient: They don't listen. ; Patient: She wasn't listening. ; Patient: She has a smart phone, brand new smart phone she got for Christmas. ; Patient: You know, out of my money from my pocket. ; Patient: Brand new smart phone, got for Christmas. ; Patient: I'm up here. ; Patient: Hello, it's time for your homework. ; Patient: Did you do your homework? ; Patient: She's just gabbing on the phone. ; Patient: Not listening. ; Patient: I took the phone, threw it out the window. ; Patient: Broke, shattered. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: But, psh. ; Therapist: And how long ago was this with the phone? ; Patient: Four or five months ago. ; Therapist: Four or five months. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So do you find that you're angry often? ; Patient: I wouldn't say I'm angry often. ; Patient: I just think is if people did what I wanted them to do, what I wanted them to do it, I wouldn't be so upset as much. ; Therapist: So you find yourself upset on occasion? ; Patient: On occasion, but again, it's just if people would listen. ; Patient: Like, I don't know if it was last year or the year before, I don't know when it was. ; Patient: Like, it was one of those Thanksgivings and just my whole family's around, you know, Thanksgiving, watching football. ; Patient: I'm cooking dinner, you know, busy all in the kitchen. ; Patient: Everything's hot and whatnot. ; Patient: I've got this whole gourmet meal made. ; Patient: My brother's there, his family's there, you know, my husband's family's there, everybody's there. ; Patient: Everybody, it's time to eat. ; Patient: Everybody, it's time to eat. ; Patient: They think this football game is more interesting than my food. ; Patient: I spent all day making this. ; Patient: So it's like, you know, just went, took the TV, thought about throwing it at my brother. ; Patient: He's 45 years old. ; Patient: He should be listening, you know. ; Patient: But just threw it on the ground, smashed it. ; Patient: Now you will listen. ; Patient: I stood there, screamed for a little bit, got it all out. ; Patient: I felt so good to get it out. ; Patient: I stood there, screamed, they're all staring, but they ate. ; Therapist: Do you feel like you planned to throw the TV or just something came up in the moment? ; Patient: It just happened. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I'm not planning or anything, but I just want them to eat, you know. ; Therapist: It was more of a spur of the moment thing. ; Patient: A spur of the moment, completely a spur of the moment. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: But it got their attention. ; Patient: They ate. ; Therapist: It got their attention, the TV, it had been broken. ; Therapist: So? ; Therapist: All right, so this has, your anger and some of your behaviors caused some recent trouble with the law. ; Therapist: That's why you're here. ; Patient: Everything, like I said, is blown out of proportion. ; Patient: There's no need for police, no need for the courts or anything. ; Patient: It's like... ; Therapist: But now they're involved and you feel like counseling might be helpful. ; Patient: If I want to keep my job, yes. ; Patient: I can't go to jail. ; Patient: I'm like, I can't face any charges. ; Patient: I can't do that. ; Patient: So counseling would be helpful in that regard. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: But I don't see it as a problem. ; Therapist: You don't see the anger as a problem? ; Patient: Uh-huh. ; Patient: I don't see what everybody's talking about. ; Patient: My husband says I have these anger issues. ; Patient: My kids say I throw a tantrum like a two-year-old. ; Patient: But I don't see, I don't see it. ; Therapist: You're just not seeing it? ; Patient: I don't see it. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you have any history of medical problems, mental health problems? ; Patient: Nuh-uh. ; Therapist: You ever use drugs or alcohol? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: Clean as a whistle. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it seems like you are open to the idea of counseling. ; Therapist: I'd like to get you scheduled with one of our counselors. ; Therapist: I'll get you in a couple days if that works. ; Patient: That'll work. ; Patient: It's gonna have to work. ; Therapist: I appreciate you answering these questions. ; Therapist: This has been helpful, and I'll get you set up with the counselor. ; Patient: All right.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Do you have on your presentation, do you have so many bullet points you want to cover? ; Patient: Yeah, like an outline sort of thing. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Would it help to time the deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points? ; Patient: I never thought about that. ; Therapist: I don't know how many bullet points you'd have in a presentation. ; Therapist: Maybe you'd have 10 or 20? ; Patient: Something like that, yeah. ; Therapist: Depending on how long it is. ; Therapist: So maybe you, as you start to review a certain bullet point, as you're trying to get it into your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply and then as you continue on you just let out that breath really slowly. ; Patient: Like a rhythm sort of. ; Therapist: Yeah, I could do that. ; Therapist: And then you go to the next bullet point and do the same thing. ; Patient: Never thought about it that way. ; Therapist: I'm just thinking it'd be some way to structure so you would get in so many breaths. ; Patient: So I wouldn't forget, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Just make sure you keep your bullet points at a length that would work. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Not a few paragraphs. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: But just a few seconds each so you can get a good deep breath. ; Therapist: Or you could, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously several breaths. ; Therapist: But just some rhythm that you could kind of grab onto something concrete. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because I know that in that moment things are probably, like you mentioned, zoning out. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: It becomes very easy to lose your anchors. ; Patient: Yeah, exactly. ; Patient: And just get really foggy, almost dizzy. ; Therapist: Yeah, so if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths, that might be something you can really grab onto. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And would kind of cut through that fogginess of something you could still do. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: When's the next presentation in that class that's coming up? ; Patient: The next one I believe is next Friday. ; Therapist: Is that the next presentation you have in all the classes? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And that's next Friday. ; Therapist: Do you know where you are in the order, like for presenting? ; Patient: I think I'm actually third in this one. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: So not first. ; Therapist: Not first. ; Therapist: And this one's how many minutes? ; Patient: Like 15 or so. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: It's a little shorter than 20 minutes. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So 15 minutes, so you have about a half hour, maybe a little more if there's time to switch out of kind of sitting there. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And potential time where you could be anxious. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: But also potential time when you could be reviewing, denotes your bullet points, and breathing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And saying to yourself that kind of self-talk that they're not really paying attention to me anyway. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Because that might help reduce that anxiety. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What's one thing you could say to yourself when you're up there? ; Patient: I guess I could say that in general I do pretty well. ; Patient: One bad grade I think going to make me doesn't mean that I don't deserve to be here. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So the self-talk up there could be I deserve to be here. ; Patient: Maybe I've prepared enough. ; Patient: You know that I know that I've prepared and I'm a good student. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I've prepared enough. ; Therapist: I'm a good student. ; Therapist: I do deserve to be here. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Is that something it would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you can... ; Patient: Yeah, I think it would actually. ; Therapist: You can recite that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Internally as you... ; Patient: Because it's not long, I think I could. ; Patient: It would be easy to remember and I could just like maybe put it down on one of my note cards in front of me or something. ; Therapist: And how much do you believe that those statements are true? ; Patient: I think, you know, sitting here now I believe them. ; Patient: In the moment sometimes it's a little hard to believe because I convince myself otherwise. ; Patient: But I think I actually believe that that's true, that I do deserve to be in the program. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Those self-talk items, you believe them to be true. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this, you might not believe them as much. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But remember that, you know, we worked on them. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: You came up with them. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you believe them now. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you're ready to recite them. ; Therapist: It's easy, I realize it's easy to form these plans. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But in the chaos of the anxiety and the worry it's harder. ; Therapist: So the more tasks you can make concrete and that you can write down and you can rehearse, I think the better off you'll be. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I would like to see you, your presentations next Friday. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I would like to see you right before that, so it will be about a week before that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you have any questions? ; Therapist: These are items you can rehearse still, even without the presentation, the self-talk and ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: the breathing and of course preparing. ; Therapist: But do you have any questions between now and then, do you think? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Patient: I think it makes sense. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you understand kind of the plan to Yeah. ; Therapist: attack that anxiety symptom? ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I think what you kind of suggested before, like maybe practicing my deep breathing, like maybe now, like when I'm calm and getting into a habit of deep breathing, like I'm more apt to also remember it then. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So, good. ; Therapist: So you have some kind of behavioral pieces. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: The focus on studying, the breathing and some cognitive pieces, the self-talk we talked about. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: The seated and that you use when you're at the podium. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And actually presenting. ; Therapist: All right, good. ; Therapist: So I'm glad we have a plan going forward. ; Therapist: I think that you did a really good job today helping kind of untangle all this and figure out what's going on. ; Therapist: And I appreciate that you were able to really connect with the symptoms and the thoughts and kind of realize how they're related. ; Therapist: And I feel like this is something that's going to serve you well as you move through this. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: So I'll see you in a week. ; Patient: Okay, thanks. ; Therapist: Thanks, Hazel.",

; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: It's really hard. ; Patient: So like when I'm in the middle of being worried, it's really hard for me to focus. ; Patient: So I can't focus on like what I need to do because I feel like my mind is on a lot of different things and I can't focus on exactly what I should be doing. ; Patient: It's just like I'm worried about all the different aspects. ; Therapist: Alright, so your ability to concentrate through the hard work of preparing. ; Patient: Yeah, to like focus my energy on the right things. ; Patient: I'm just like wasting time worrying. ; Therapist: Alright, so this excessive worrying and all this interfering of preparing, all this goes on right up until you're getting ready to present? ; Patient: Yeah, and then like while I'm presenting. ; Therapist: So let's talk about that. ; Therapist: Let's go into the actual day of presenting. ; Therapist: So we have this excessive worry coming in. ; Therapist: It's interfering with your ability to prepare. ; Therapist: It's distressing for you. ; Therapist: Now it's what in class, these presentations are in class. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you're in the classroom. ; Therapist: Do you, are you the only one to present during that class or does it rotate through several people? ; Patient: It depends on the presentation. ; Patient: Sometimes there's like one or two other people that have to present that night depending on like how long the topic is. ; Therapist: Alright, well let's use the last time you present in that class as a tempo. ; Therapist: What was the order? ; Therapist: Like what order did you go in there? ; Patient: The one, well the one that I really messed up I think I was first, but usually like I'm like second maybe. ; Therapist: Okay, so for this example let's say you're the second. ; Therapist: So you're sitting in the classroom and another student is presenting. ; Therapist: What's going through your mind then? ; Patient: I feel like I am totally zoned out. ; Patient: Like I'm not even paying attention to what that person is saying because I'm so worried about how I'm going to mess it up. ; Patient: You know, I'm starting to like be sweaty, like my hands are clammy, my heart's starting to race a little bit and I'm just totally zoned out on what they're doing. ; Patient: I'm just you know worrying about what's going to happen when I get up there. ; Therapist: Alright, so in that moment as you're seated you're not really watching their presentation as much because you have these strong, or somewhat strong physical symptoms. ; Therapist: You have your heart racing a bit you said, sweaty palms, you're zoned out. ; Therapist: Have you ever felt the need, desire to like run out of the room? ; Patient: Yes, it's funny you should say that. ; Patient: I was a little bit hesitant to mention that but I kind of, I do, I feel like I need to find an excuse to like use the bathroom or I just need to get out of there. ; Therapist: Yeah, so what do you feel is most pressuring you to leave the room? ; Therapist: Like what symptom? ; Patient: I would say that just like my anxiety and my heart rate are starting to increase and I feel like I just need to get out of there. ; Therapist: What thoughts going through your mind right then? ; Therapist: Like so let's take that kind of most severe moment when you're, let's just say we're still before the presentation. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So you're sitting at the desk and your heart rate's elevated and you're not focusing on what they're doing, you're zoned out, your anxiety is high. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What thought is going through your mind right then? ; Patient: I think I'm thinking like I'm going to bond this anyway so I might as well just you know not go through the stress of having to do it. ; Patient: Like I've already in my head I know that it's going to end badly. ; Therapist: So I've already, I've already failed? ; Patient: Right, so there's no sense in getting up there and maybe if I don't get up there you know, I guess it couldn't be any worse so I might as well just leave. ; Therapist: Are you embarrassed that the professor or other students will see that you were really anxious? ; Patient: Yeah, I don't want, I figure if I leave then people will just maybe think I was sick or whatever and it'll be a better situation if I just left than having to see me up there you know sweating and all this, these other symptoms that I have when I actually get up there. ; Patient: It would be better just to leave before that starts. ; Therapist: Okay, so better to be thought ill that you just had to leave because you're sick. ; Patient: Yeah, or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody you know. ; Therapist: Have a severe anxiety in front of everybody and then they can see. ; Patient: Very embarrassing. ; Therapist: Yeah, that would be, that would be a very undesirable outcome for you. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So as you're debating that thought, like if that's coming to your head and you're thinking I just need to flee. ; Patient: Yeah, I just got to get out here. ; Therapist: What happens there? ; Therapist: So we're maybe, what maybe 15 minutes before you present? ; Therapist: So tell me about that. ; Therapist: So you have that thought, you want to flee. ; Patient: Right and I'm looking at the clock and saying you know like how much more time in this presentation before I have to go, like should I go, should I not go, what are the consequences of running out you know and kind of playing out which would be worse. ; Therapist: Have you ever had to run out? ; Patient: Once I went to the bathroom to try to like calm myself down or talk to myself or you know like cool off my face. ; Patient: But I came back. ; Therapist: And you presented. ; Patient: Yeah and then I presented. ; Therapist: Alright so you, you survived one of the more stressful. ; Patient: Yeah, I almost felt like I was going to be ill. ; Patient: I was so stressed that day. ; Therapist: That was very, very tough on you. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: That particular day. ; Therapist: You did survive it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, it was just very unpleasant. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So now we're, now we're right about to where it's time to get up and present. ; Therapist: Right, so let's say in this scenario, if you haven't fled but you had those thoughts. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you're anxious and you have some physical symptoms going on. ; Therapist: You get up and it's time to present. ; Therapist: What's the sequence from this point on? ; Patient: So typically like I go to load my presentation. ; Patient: At this point like I have my new cards or whatever in front of me. ; Patient: I am like shaking at this point. ; Patient: I am so, I don't know if it's scared or worried or maybe a combination of everything and I'm just like sweating. ; Patient: My heart is racing. ; Patient: Like I almost feel dizzy. ; Patient: I'm just so stressed out about what's going to happen and then you know I'm starting to speak and then the presentations are usually like 20 minutes or so. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: So I have to stay up there for the duration and I'm just like you know sweating and then I'm wondering like are people looking at me or people, can people see it? ; Patient: You know am I going to forget something? ; Therapist: So the, so the thoughts are I wonder if they can see how anxious I am. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: I wonder if I'm going to do poorly on the presentation. ; Patient: Right or they think I've been lazy and I didn't prepare or are they going to think that you know I'm dumb or I don't know you know what I'm doing? ; Patient: What are they going to think about me? ; Therapist: So they might, they might think less of you as a person. ; Patient: Right or like be judging me. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So there's a number of concerns that kind of go into your mind in that moment. ; Therapist: So when does it start to turn around? ; Therapist: So you start presenting, it's 20 minutes. ; Therapist: You initially get up there and get your presentation up on the, like the projection monitor, something like that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: When does it start to turn the corner? ; Patient: It depends. ; Patient: Sometimes I settle down a little bit but then usually like that, I get some sort of rhythm I think and then, but then I get anxiety again until I get my grades. ; Patient: Do you know what I mean? ; Patient: And I'm like until, cause I feel like I'm going to do poorly until that happens. ; Therapist: When do you receive the grades? ; Patient: Sometimes like she usually doesn't give them that day, but like often like the next day or the day after. ; Therapist: So does that intense anxiety that you're having while you're presenting last all the way to now? ; Patient: No, it's definitely like dissipates once I can like go sit down. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, so the, so the next big drop off for symptoms would be when you're done the presentation. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: When eyes are maybe no longer on me, they've moved on to somebody else. ; Patient: So I figure like, okay, they forgot about me. ; Patient: I'm safe for right then. ; Therapist: But then there's this other worry of now we have to see what the grades are going to be. ; Patient: And I convince myself that I did poorly. ; Therapist: So the thought that's going through your mind is I'm going to receive a bad grade. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And that everyone saw me, you know, sweating and all these symptoms that I have, everyone is judging me.",

; Therapist: I know you've been down for a while. ; Therapist: What's going on? ; Patient: I just feel like everything's going to be okay. ; Therapist: This is unusual for you because usually you come and talk to me, cut down, depressed. ; Therapist: Something changed recently? ; Patient: I just feel like I've found the solution and I know what I'm going to do. ; Patient: I'm not really worried about my depression so I guess I'm feeling a little bit better about it. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about the solution you found for depression? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I know we've talked about it before. ; Patient: I think that I'm going to commit suicide. ; Therapist: You want to commit suicide? ; Therapist: Do you know how you did that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I have some pills in my house in the medicine cabinet and I'm going to take those. ; Therapist: When do you plan on doing this? ; Patient: Probably a couple days from now. ; Patient: I have some things to get in order. ; Patient: I want to arrange things and make sure that everything's in order and then I'll do it. ; Therapist: What kind of things do you need to arrange? ; Patient: I want to make sure that all the documents my husband's going to need, that they're in a place that he can find them. ; Patient: I'm not going to tell him but I don't want to make things more difficult for him. ; Patient: Just that kind of thing. ; Patient: Make sure that everything's in order so that when I'm gone everybody has what they need. ; Therapist: Jill, you've been seeing me for almost a year now and you know by telling me this that I'm going to act to stop you. ; Therapist: I'm going to try to stop you from killing yourself. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I want to do it. ; Patient: I think in the end it's what's going to make things better. ; Patient: But I guess there's still a part of me that doesn't want to die, doesn't want to do that to my family. ; Patient: So I guess I'm telling you because I'm not 100% resolved and I guess I wanted to talk it over. ; Therapist: You seem pretty serious though about your timetable and your plan. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, it's like when you plan to go on a weekend trip. ; Patient: You're pretty sure you're going to go but if the weather's bad you might not. ; Patient: So I think, you know, I'm pretty sure. ; Therapist: Is there anything that can stop you? ; Patient: Um, I don't know. ; Patient: I don't, I think, I mean, I feel pretty sure about it. ; Therapist: Do you feel like it's the depression or something else that drove you to this decision? ; Patient: I feel like, I feel like it's just, you know, the same old things that I was worried about before. ; Patient: You know, the depression and, you know, my relational issues, my job, like the stuff that gets me down. ; Patient: And, you know, it just clicked and it was like, you know, I've thought about it before but like I feel like I'm going to feel better. ; Patient: I feel like it's just going to, I'm going to feel better so. ; Therapist: As you said, it's a solution. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I feel like you come with a solution. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright, now we've talked about this issue in the past, right? ; Therapist: And when you've come in feeling this way, kind of resolved to harm yourself, we sent you over to the hospital. ; Therapist: I know that's not your favorite place but when you go there for however long, it's been usually about five days, you come out feeling a lot better. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you feel like this time would be different? ; Patient: Well, I feel like in the past, you know, I've been thinking about killing myself seriously but now I'm not as scared of it. ; Patient: So I don't really want you to put me in the hospital because then I won't be able to do it. ; Patient: And before I was scared so I wanted you to put me in the hospital but now I just want to get it over with and so I really don't want you to do that. ; Therapist: So, like, it's like a part of you saying that you don't want me to stop you but yet you came in here and you told me. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So a part of you seems to be maybe not quite sure. ; Patient: I guess there will always be a part of me that's a human, you know, that's scared to die and I care about you, you know. ; Patient: I know you're my counselor but like we've had a relationship and we talk about these kinds of things and I felt like I owed it to you to, you know, be honest with you about how I was feeling because we've had that relationship in the past. ; Patient: And so I guess I came here because of that and because I felt like I just wanted to talk it over, you know, before I did it because, you know, I come to you to talk about what I'm thinking and so I felt like this would help me like gain the final clarity that I needed. ; Therapist: Has it helped you gain any clarity? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I guess I see that you're saying that like I really need to go to the hospital. ; Patient: I guess I was hoping a little bit that you would be happy for me that I was feeling better but I think that you want me to go to the hospital so I don't know. ; Patient: It makes me think about whether it's the right decision, you know. ; Therapist: You mean the suicide? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Sometimes, you know, you've been with me like I said about almost a year now and you've been depressed much of that time and it's not unusual when somebody thinks they've found a solution to depression. ; Therapist: Even if that solution is something that I am against like suicide that their mood would become elevated because you see an end to the pain. ; Therapist: There's other things we can do and have done in the past to try to get you out of pain. ; Patient: But we have done them in the past and I didn't feel better and now I am feeling better so, you know, I just want you to accept that. ; Therapist: But I'm not going to. ; Therapist: It's my obligation that I'm happy to fulfill to try to keep you alive. ; Therapist: I've seen you this way before and I know it may not seem this way now but when you came out from the suicidal thoughts and the feelings you did well for weeks, sometimes months at a time. ; Therapist: You're seeing really just the darkest when you're in the... ; Patient: Yeah, but I'm feeling better now. ; Therapist: Temporarily. ; Therapist: Sometimes you feel you've found an end to the pain. ; Therapist: Which I understand. ; Therapist: I mean I understand you're feeling better but you're feeling better because you plan on killing yourself. ; Therapist: And we've talked about how devastating that would be to your family, right, to your friends. ; Therapist: You have all these goals in your life. ; Patient: Yeah, but I'm just torturing them with my sadness. ; Patient: I'm just making their lives miserable. ; Patient: I don't understand how it's going to help them for me to stay alive. ; Patient: You know, I'm worth more. ; Patient: They can have my life insurance and, you know, I won't make them suffer anymore. ; Therapist: So your logic is that if you end your life, you'll free them from having to deal with you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It feels like the right thing to do. ; Therapist: As you know, I mean, you've signed releases. ; Therapist: I've talked to your husband, your parents. ; Therapist: They repeatedly said that despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with your depression, they would much rather have you alive. ; Therapist: Why would they say that? ; Patient: I think that they're scared of the pain of losing me but I know that they'll feel better eventually. ; Therapist: So they'll get over the grief. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I understand. ; Patient: And I think that they'll understand that I needed this. ; Therapist: You know, I've been doing this for a while, right? ; Therapist: I think we've come to have a good relationship. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And I would hope that I've earned your trust and your value in my opinion. ; Therapist: Can I share with you something that I know about suicide? ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: You open hearing it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: There's a lot of ways that people die, right? ; Therapist: And it's really what eventually will happen to us all. ; Therapist: It's hard for me to imagine a way more devastating than suicide. ; Therapist: Meaning when somebody dies of an illness or a car accident or any other type of tragic accident, people grieve, right? ; Therapist: But there's usually not a blame assigned to that. ; Therapist: I mean, they don't feel guilty. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Therapist: They feel sad because they've lost the person but they don't feel responsible for that person's death. ; Therapist: Suicide is different. ; Therapist: When somebody commits suicide, their family and friends feel responsible. ; Therapist: They have no answers to all the questions that they have. ; Therapist: They can never get answers. ; Patient: I'm going to write them a note and tell them everything and tell them it's not their fault because it's not their fault and I just want them to be happy without me. ; Therapist: So you believe the note will take away all that pain? ; Patient: No, but I think that it will help them realize that they shouldn't feel guilty like you're saying. ; Therapist: It will mitigate that pain? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I can tell you from experience that notes don't really help. ; Therapist: If anything, it's another artifact that they can agonize over. ; Therapist: I know it's hard to see from your perspective because you're kind of resolved to this and you feel stuck in the pain and you want out, but they will miss you and they will agonize for the rest of their lives because they lost you. ; Therapist: And it's a special horrible type of agony that comes with feeling responsible for causing someone's death. ; Therapist: And I know you don't want that. ; Patient: I just want to feel better. ; Patient: I just don't know why you can't let me feel better. ; Therapist: I know it's frustrating and I know it's hard to understand. ; Therapist: The times when you've gone to the hospital before, you have felt better. ; Therapist: Your outlook was completely different. ; Therapist: Not 100%, but it was completely different when you came out. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: I mean you're still a little down, but nowhere near the depression where you'd want to hurt yourself. ; Therapist: Is it possible that if you go to the hospital this time, you could come out feeling better again? ; Patient: Yeah, it's possible. ; Therapist: I'm going to make arrangements to get you over to the hospital. ; Patient: I don't want to go to the hospital. ; Therapist: I know. ; Therapist: I know you don't. ; Therapist: And we've had this conversation before. ; Therapist: I realize that you're not happy with some of the conditions there, but you usually talk finally about the groups. ; Therapist: You usually do well in the groups. ; Therapist: And typically, well every time you've been to the hospital you come out feeling better. ; Therapist: I know it's not what you want to hear. ; Therapist: I know you want me to be happy that you're going to end your life, but that wouldn't make me happy. ; Therapist: That wouldn't make anybody happy. ; Therapist: I know you think it would make you happy, but I can tell you it's not the answer. ; Therapist: I'd like you to go voluntarily through this process. ; Therapist: Will you do that? ; Patient: Go. ; Therapist: You'll go? ; Patient: Alright. ; Therapist: So I'm going to make arrangements to get you there. ; Therapist: And when you're there and they're getting ready to discharge you, make sure you set up an appointment to see me right away. ; Therapist: Because usually I'm going to keep you about five, maybe ten days at the most. ; Therapist: So I know they take care of this, but I'm going to ask you this too. ; Therapist: Make sure that you have an appointment set up to see me so I can see you right after you get out. ; Therapist: Can you do that for me? ; Patient: Alright. ; Therapist: I'm going to go make those arrangements and we'll get you over there. ; Therapist: We'll get you over there, okay?",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hello Alyssa. ; Patient: Hello. ; Therapist: It's good to see you today. ; Therapist: I'm glad you came to see me. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, tell me a little bit more about why you're here. ; Patient: Um, well I guess I have anger issues. ; Patient: I just find myself getting mad all the time. ; Patient: And uh, feeling all the trouble over it. ; Patient: People can't handle it so, I'm gonna come here for it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, which way did you come here for it? ; Patient: The courts. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Got it. ; Patient: So, yeah I'm not really, I don't really want to be here but. ; Patient: So, I'm not excited about being here. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, I hear that. ; Therapist: Well, what is your objective? ; Therapist: What do you want out of this today? ; Patient: Um, I mean I know, I'm probably a lot angrier than the average person. ; Patient: So, I mean people do a lot of things to make me mad. ; Patient: So, I guess that's like a better way to not be so mad all the time. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And maybe manage that a little bit better. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Tell me, um, is it school when you're getting mad? ; Therapist: Is it home when you're getting mad? ; Therapist: Is it friends? ; Therapist: So, tell me about that little bit. ; Patient: Um, just with my friends I'm cool. ; Patient: It's just definitely at home with my mom. ; Patient: We fight almost every day. ; Patient: And at school I get, I get the teachers. ; Patient: So, I get like detention and stuff like that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, before we get into this a little bit, I'd like to tell you a little bit about your brain. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Have you ever heard of the amygdala? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: When you get into high school, you're going to know about this in advance, but you're going to learn about this in high school science. ; Therapist: So, your amygdala is like right here at the base of your brain back here. ; Therapist: And it's known as the alarm center. ; Therapist: So, you think about pulling an alarm, you know, an alarm is going off in your brain. ; Therapist: And that alarm normally it indicates fight, flight, or freeze. ; Therapist: So, it makes you want to fight, fight back, right? ; Therapist: It makes you want to freeze, you just kind of panic, freeze, don't know what you do. ; Therapist: Or flight, which means get out of there, you know, get away. ; Therapist: Get away. ; Therapist: Alright? ; Therapist: So, that's kind of what your brain, that's the alarm system, that's kind of your brain. ; Therapist: So, let's think about some situations when you're in these angry situations. ; Therapist: And let's just kind of step through them. ; Therapist: So, give me an example, really specific of maybe two. ; Therapist: When the alarm is going off and you are really angry. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm definitely a fighter. ; Therapist: Okay, you're a fighter. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Patient: Because just thinking, just yesterday with my mom, she told me to do this, which I was going to do. ; Patient: I just wanted the show to end. ; Patient: She kept yelling at me to do it. ; Patient: And I didn't like the way she was yelling at me. ; Patient: And I just wanted to do like I was going to do it. ; Patient: Because she would just shut up about it. ; Patient: So, I mean it just pissed me off. ; Patient: So, I started yelling at her and she started yelling at me. ; Patient: And then a little brother came in, it was just the whole family. ; Patient: And everyone was just yelling at me. ; Patient: And I don't remember all the details, but I just remember I ended up punching a wall. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: That was just yesterday. ; Therapist: Okay, that was just yesterday. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So, the situation, mom asked you to do something, you were kind of in the middle of something, she got past your knee and you started yelling, she started yelling, it starts escalating, you punch a wall. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I got that situation. ; Therapist: Tell me about a situation at school where your alarm center is like going off. ; Patient: My history teacher, sometimes just looking at her, she just has this attitude, she's not walking in. ; Patient: And then, but I mean it's such a boring teacher, so I tend to sleep in class and I can't help it. ; Patient: And then she'll call me out for the whole class. ; Patient: And it just makes me mad. ; Patient: And we'll start going back and forth saying stuff and it goes, I end up cussing her out. ; Patient: And that's when I had to go to detention. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: I see. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you're in class, teacher's calling you out, and you're just wondering if a lot of anger and cursing get you in the nice place. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Jane, good example. ; Therapist: Is there any time when there's anxiety that's happening before the anger comes out? ; Therapist: When you're in bad anxiety. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Like maybe, yeah, if you ever get anxious where you just kind of freeze, or yours are more of a reactive of a fight, of a lash out, of a get it out. ; Therapist: That's kind of your response. ; Patient: I don't want to feel something, I have to get it out. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I can't even think of a time when I actually stop to think. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I think that's good. ; Therapist: Well, I want you to, it's kind of helpful, I think, to understand a little bit about what's going on in your brain, and then you can maybe help monitor it, help control it, help manage it a little bit better. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So let's, I'd like to take you through an example of something. ; Therapist: It's called, and it's a way of, it's called wise mind. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You're trying to be very conscientious about what's going on around you, how you're feeling, and how you're going to react. ; Therapist: Instead of just reacting, when that alarm goes off, you're going to think about it, name it, and then react. ; Therapist: Hopefully, maybe we can get a little bit more control on anger reactions coming. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And I need that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I don't want to see myself being too good at it, but. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, you know what, Alyssa? ; Therapist: Knowing that you need that, just saying, I need that, that's a really big step. ; Therapist: It really is. ; Therapist: Some people don't even acknowledge that they need it, don't want to acknowledge it, don't care to acknowledge it, and they're not going to really get any, not going to change. ; Therapist: But you're here. ; Therapist: Maybe you don't want to be here. ; Therapist: But I'm hearing you say that you want to make a change, and that's really huge, because I think you want things to be different for yourself, it sounds like. ; Therapist: I mean. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: But also, just watch people with something messing with them. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, there's a desire there, I see, and I appreciate that, and that's great. ; Therapist: And there are lots of different techniques for this, and I'm just going to offer one today, and then you can practice it all week, and then when we talk next week, we'll kind of see how you are with that, and if it's not working for you, we'll make modifications, we might change this, okay? ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And this is a technique where you can do it at school, at home, and it only takes about one minute. ; Therapist: Sometimes we don't have a lot of time. ; Therapist: You know, it's great when you can take 15 minutes to calm down, maybe you're going to bed at night, and you're doing something that makes you calm down, and it's quiet, but a lot of time, in the heat of the moment, we don't have a lot of time. ; Therapist: Or when you feel that anger rising, there's not a lot of time, all right? ; Patient: It happens. ; Therapist: It happens a lot. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: This little procedure is called STOP. ; Therapist: S-T-O-P. ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: It's an acronym, S-T-O-P. ; Therapist: So S-T-O-P. ; Therapist: So it means, the first, the S, is to stop. ; Therapist: So, for example, you're watching TV, and your mom says, Alyssa, can you do this, please? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Right then and there, you're going to say, okay, stop, and then you're going to take a breath. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Therapist: You're going to breathe in, breathe deeply, and you're going to breathe out. ; Therapist: Just like take two deep breaths, and think about your breathing. ; Therapist: Breathe in, and breathe out. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Therapist: So the T is for take a breath. ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: Take a breath. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And when you're taking a breath, think about, you know, your brain really needs a lot of oxygen. ; Therapist: So when you're breathing in, you're breathing oxygen into your lungs, gets into your blood, gets to your brain. ; Therapist: You're getting a lot of oxygen in your brain, which really helps you think better. ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: So you're breathing in, getting that oxygen right there. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: The O means observe. ; Therapist: What is going on around you right now? ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: So in this situation, your mom asks you to do the dishes. ; Therapist: You're watching a program. ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: You'd like to finish the program, I think I heard you say, and then you're going to do the dishes. ; Therapist: That's how you would like it. ; Therapist: It may not be how mom would like it, but you might be able to, if you can kind of get, observe the situation and how you're feeling. ; Therapist: I'm a little mad. ; Therapist: Mom just asked me to do it. ; Therapist: Doesn't she see I'm like watching a show here? ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: So you're observing how you're feeling. ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: Watching the show. ; Therapist: I'm getting frustrated that she's asking me to do this right now. ; Therapist: Observe it, name it, claim it, and say, okay, that's how I'm feeling right now. ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: So you're just aware. ; Therapist: You're observing the situation and how you're feeling. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Therapist: And then the, so the O is for observe. ; Therapist: And the P is for proceed. ; Therapist: That means move forward. ; Therapist: But something that's going to benefit you. ; Therapist: That's going to be positive. ; Therapist: That's going to work for you. ; Therapist: Yelling at your mom. ; Therapist: Is that working for you? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Get you in trouble. ; Therapist: Get your hand in the wall. ; Therapist: You might get hurt. ; Therapist: Moving forward, yelling at your mom's not working for you too well, is it? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So we're going to proceed with something that's going to work for you. ; Therapist: In this situation, do you have an idea that might work for you? ; Patient: Um, I mean I just talk to her, but it's just so hard to talk to her without yelling. ; Patient: But I mean I guess if I stopped, I wouldn't be like quite so mad. ; Patient: So I just tell her that. ; Patient: I'm going to do it later. ; Patient: But I mean I see her get pissed off about that. ; Patient: I just want to get that out. ; Therapist: But it's a good idea though. ; Therapist: It's a good thought. ; Therapist: It might be worth a try to say. ; Therapist: And maybe it's more instead of telling her I'm going to do it later, saying, Mom, I've got ten more minutes with this show. ; Therapist: Here's ten more minutes. ; Therapist: I'm really interested in this show. ; Therapist: Can I just finish the ten more minutes and then I will do the dishes? ; Therapist: Kind of put it in a question. ; Therapist: So instead of saying, I'm going to do it later, say, I just got ten more minutes and I really want to finish this show. ; Therapist: Is it okay if I just do the dishes as soon as, in ten minutes when I finish this show? ; Therapist: Does that sound like something that maybe? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean that's what I said before, but I mean I was kind of, I probably won't have liked the way I was saying it and stuff like that. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, I hear that. ; Therapist: Well, I'm glad you can acknowledge that. ; Therapist: That's really good. ; Therapist: That's a real big step. ; Therapist: That's a real big step. ; Therapist: So let's step through that one more time. ; Therapist: S-T-O-P. ; Therapist: The S is for? ; Patient: Stop. ; Therapist: Yeah, all right, stop. ; Therapist: Before you react, before you respond in anger, you're just going to stop. ; Therapist: What's the T? ; Patient: Take a breath. ; Therapist: Exactly. ; Therapist: Take a breath. ; Therapist: You're getting oxygen into your brain. ; Therapist: So you can think clearly, rationally. ; Therapist: Take two big breaths. ; Therapist: Three, maybe. ; Therapist: O. ; Patient: Observe. ; Therapist: Observe. ; Therapist: What's going on? ; Therapist: What's going on in my body, what are my thoughts, what's the situation? ; Therapist: You know, how am I feeling right now? ; Therapist: Name it, claim it, okay? ; Therapist: I'm going to press read in here. ; Therapist: I'm going to finish this. ; Therapist: All right, and then what's the P? ; Patient: Proceed. ; Therapist: Proceed, that's right. ; Therapist: Proceed. ; Therapist: How am I going to go forward in a way that's going to be helpful to me or good for me or benefit me, right? ; Therapist: So what, in that situation, what's the P going to be? ; Therapist: What's the proceed going to be? ; Therapist: How are you going to proceed? ; Patient: Just top of my mind, like a calmer. ; Therapist: Yeah, in a calm voice. ; Therapist: Ask her, as soon as this program is over, can I do it, mom? ; Therapist: I really want to finish this, then I promise you I'll do the dishes as soon as this program is over. ; Patient: Yeah, I'll do it with a compromise. ; Therapist: Yeah, there you go. ; Therapist: There you go. ; Therapist: In that situation, very good. ; Therapist: You're getting a little bit what you want, she's going to get what she wants, it's a great compromise. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Worth a shot? ; Therapist: Worth a try? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I'm just one. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: You know, it takes a lot of time to make a change. ; Therapist: It really does. ; Therapist: You've been doing it one way for a long time, and it takes a lot of time to do something different. ; Therapist: So I want you to be patient with yourself. ; Therapist: I want you to try this every day, all right? ; Therapist: And if you can kind of make notes for me, as we can talk about next week, like on Monday I had a fight with my mom, I tried it, it didn't work. ; Therapist: On Tuesday I had a fight with my mom, it worked a little bit, you know. ; Therapist: And the more you do this, the better you're going to get, and the more it's going to benefit you. ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: The more it's going to benefit you. ; Patient: Yeah, I see it being a little struggle in the beginning. ; Therapist: Absolutely right. ; Patient: Just the way we talk with each other, it's hard to just stop and zone out and stuff. ; Therapist: You're right. ; Therapist: You're right. ; Therapist: Because there's a certain way in the house, and it's going to be, yeah, be patient with yourself. ; Therapist: And realize this is going to take some time, okay? ; Therapist: Let's think about at school, a situation, if you wanted to take that one situation at school, too, okay? ; Therapist: Say you're in history class. ; Therapist: You're in history, but you don't get along so well. ; Therapist: You're in your history class, and she's calling on you, right? ; Therapist: This is when you get angry. ; Therapist: Is that correct about that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: How can I stop when she's calling on me? ; Patient: Like I had to answer that. ; Therapist: Now, is she asking you, so is she saying, okay, Alyssa, tell me the answer to this question? ; Therapist: Is that what she's calling? ; Therapist: Or is she saying Alyssa, wake up, because you're asleep? ; Therapist: What is she saying? ; Patient: Yeah, she wants to trick me because she knows I was sleeping and not paying attention, so she asks me that thing, ; Patient: took a question, and obviously I don't know. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You're going to step through this stop process with that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So your teacher's going to ask you, Alyssa, why don't you tell us about that? ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: Instead of what's the normal reaction for you? ; Therapist: Your alarm center going off. ; Therapist: What's the normal reaction for you? ; Patient: I don't know, teacher. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You're going to try to stop. ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: You're going to take a breath. ; Therapist: Two breaths. ; Therapist: You're going to say, all right, how you feeling at that point? ; Therapist: She's embarrassing me. ; Therapist: I don't know. ; Therapist: What else is going on? ; Patient: Angry. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Angry. ; Therapist: She knows I don't know. ; Therapist: She's just trying to test me. ; Therapist: She knows I don't know the answer because I'm asleep. ; Patient: Yeah, she just knows. ; Patient: She's been calling, but she's just messing with me. ; Patient: She's just messing with me. ; Therapist: So it's frustrating. ; Therapist: Exactly. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So you're naming that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: I'm frustrated. ; Therapist: She doesn't know the answer. ; Therapist: Why is she calling me? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You're observing what's going on in the situation, but how are you going to proceed in a positive way? ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: Instead of yelling and getting sent out of the room, can you think of a way that might benefit you more? ; Therapist: It might be to your advantage. ; Therapist: Getting out of the room and going down the hall is not helping you too much. ; Therapist: So what's a way you can proceed? ; Therapist: You are frustrated. ; Therapist: You are maybe a little bit embarrassed. ; Therapist: You maybe don't know the answer. ; Therapist: What can you do instead of yell at that teacher and get angry at her? ; Therapist: What are the other thoughts maybe? ; Patient: This is just how I don't know. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I don't know what to say. ; Therapist: Well, that's the truth. ; Therapist: You might know or you may not know, but that's the truth. ; Therapist: You can say just simply that. ; Therapist: I don't know. ; Therapist: Then she's going to go to somebody else, right? ; Patient: Maybe. ; Therapist: Maybe? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: That would be the hope that she goes to somebody else. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: But for you, you won't be sent out of the room. ; Therapist: You won't be getting in trouble. ; Therapist: You won't be in ISS for the day and missing out. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: One objective I want for you in school is for you to get to the next grade. ; Therapist: Get to the next grade. ; Therapist: You've got to be in that classroom. ; Therapist: Learn a little bit so you can get to the next grade. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm going to want to. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: You've got a desire to do that. ; Therapist: So this procedure only takes 45 seconds or so for you to stop, take a few breaths, observe what's going on, kind of name your emotions. ; Therapist: Okay, I'm this and this and this. ; Therapist: However, don't want to respond with angry words or yelling or cursing because it's not going to benefit me. ; Therapist: Trying to make a change here. ; Therapist: Then I'm going to figure out what is my best tool to proceed that's going to help me. ; Therapist: Work out an arrangement with mom or just tell the teacher you don't know. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And again, be patient with yourself because this type of change takes a while. ; Patient: Yeah, it's probably going to take a while. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Are you willing to maybe practice this once a day, every day? ; Therapist: It can either be at home or it can be in the classroom this next week? ; Patient: Yeah, I know something comes up and it's open to all school models. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm going to just try it and see how it works. ; Therapist: If this, I have a lot of tricks up my sleeve, so if this one isn't working, we can modify it or we can try something else. ; Therapist: But try this every day and then we'll just kind of talk about it next week and just kind of see how it's going. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Listen, I appreciate you wanting to make change and willing to do something about that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: All right.",

; Therapist: Thank you for coming today. ; Therapist: How did you get here? ; Therapist: Did you travel by car or train? ; Therapist: How did you find the traffic? ; Patient: Yeah, I drove today and the traffic wasn't too bad actually. ; Patient: I got here in about 15 or 20 minutes. ; Patient: Oh, that's good. ; Patient: I was held up. ; Patient: There was a big smash on the road so it took me a little bit longer. ; Therapist: So I'm glad that you were able to make it in. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: Julie, I'm glad that you've made the effort to come in today. ; Therapist: How did you hear about our service? ; Patient: Well, I was talking to a friend and saying that I thought I might benefit from having a chat to somebody. ; Patient: And she told me that one of her friends had actually come to your service before and said that it was very good. ; Therapist: Excellent. ; Therapist: Well, thank you for coming in. ; Therapist: When you came in, you filled out some forms, which the girls have given me, which is great. ; Therapist: So that gives me a little bit of a background to where you're from and things of that nature. ; Therapist: And I just wanted to start by saying that our service is a counselling service for women. ; Therapist: And therefore you fit that category, which is really good. ; Therapist: Now, I just wanted to let you know that this is our first initial interview, I guess. ; Therapist: So today we will be just setting some, I'll be hearing some of your story. ; Therapist: And we'll work through a little bit of a process. ; Therapist: And then I'm sure we'll get the opportunity to meet again. ; Therapist: Is that okay? ; Patient: That sounds good. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Excellent. ; Therapist: Now, within the pack that I've given you, or the girls at the front have given you, Julie, there is some information on how we keep your privacy and confidentiality. ; Therapist: So I just wanted to clarify that before we go into our session today. ; Therapist: So within the community centre here, we do, everything that you say to me today is kept within a confidential environment. ; Therapist: However, I am a mandatory reporter, which means that if you tell me something that I feel that you may be at risk, or you may be at risk of harm to yourself or hurting someone else. ; Therapist: If you have children, if they may be at risk, or if you're participating in illegal activity, I am a mandatory reporter, and I will need to let somebody know about that so that we can try to get you some help and assistance in dealing with that particular situation. ; Therapist: Is that okay? ; Patient: Yes, that's fine. ; Patient: I understand. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Therapist: Excellent. ; Therapist: So Julie, let's just start by, what has brought you here today? ; Patient: Well, my husband and I have been fighting on and off the last couple of months, and I'm just noticing that we can't seem to come to any agreement lately. ; Patient: I'm losing sleep, I'm feeling exhausted, and I'm at a point where I feel like I might like to leave the marriage. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How long have you been married for? ; Patient: We've been together for eight years. ; Therapist: Oh, wow. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's a decent amount of time. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And do you have any children? ; Patient: Yes, we have three children. ; Patient: I have two little ones that are under five, and we have a seven-year-old who's at school. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you must be kept busy then? ; Patient: I'm always very busy. ; Patient: There's just always so much to do, and I'm really feeling very tired. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And the children today, whereabouts? ; Therapist: Who's looking after them today for you? ; Patient: Well, my two younger children today are being cared for by my mum, and my oldest one is at school today. ; Therapist: Excellent. ; Therapist: And where's your husband today? ; Patient: He's gone to work. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: So it seems as if you're at a point in your marriage where you're feeling as if the marriage has changed a little bit, and it's focused, and you're kind of a little bit worried about what the future holds for yourself and your husband. ; Patient: I am. ; Patient: I feel now that I can't come to any solution with the problems, and he's been drinking a lot, and he always enjoyed a social drink when we first got married, but I'm noticing now that he's drinking more and more. ; Patient: He seems to be drinking most days of the week, and when he does drink, he's very, very difficult to talk to. ; Therapist: So the alcohol seems to be a problem. ; Therapist: Do you think that might be relating to the changing behaviour that you mentioned earlier? ; Patient: Yes, I do. ; Patient: I think that the drinking has definitely changed his behaviour significantly, and he's very unreasonable, and he has a very short fuse. ; Patient: He's very, very easy to make angry over the smallest of things. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: So that must be difficult for you and the children. ; Therapist: Have you noticed if the children have picked up on the change in his behaviour? ; Patient: Well, he does have a very good relationship with the children, and he actively participates in their daily lives, and the children haven't mentioned anything to me, and they don't seem to have changed their behaviour in any way. ; Patient: The arguments don't tend to happen in front of the children either. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Are the arguments something that... ; Therapist: Is it over more trivial things, or are there big, key things that you're kind of arguing with him about? ; Patient: Well, the arguments can start over something small. ; Patient: It can be just a simple argument over a task in the house. ; Patient: That can escalate into an argument about his family, or about my mother, or about money issues, and it just seems to escalate out of control. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So, Julie, have you... ; Therapist: In terms of his drinking, I'm kind of just trying to ascertain maybe what has developed in your marriage that's taken you to the point that potentially, you know, you've come to see me today. ; Therapist: And it appears as if the drinking is really the focus of perhaps your feeling of, you know, wanting to disconnect from the marriage and feeling isolated within the marriage. ; Therapist: Would that be right? ; Patient: That's true. ; Patient: That's right. ; Patient: I think the drinking is my main issue with his behaviour, and I think the drinking is greatly contributing to the way that he's behaving towards me. ; Therapist: Have you spoken to him about this? ; Patient: I have. ; Patient: I've tried to talk to him about the drinking a couple of times, and he just gets very, very defensive with me. ; Therapist: Potentially he's not acknowledging then that he may have a drinking problem. ; Patient: That's true. ; Patient: That's correct. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: I can understand that this must be difficult for you, Julie, and I'm pleased that you've come here today to try to, you know, work through some of these issues. ; Therapist: Now, Julie, in terms of, I guess, your commitment to the marriage, in terms of where you want the marriage kind of to go, do you think that you have a strong base that you can potentially, you know, if we were able to help your husband with the drinking side of things, that your marriage itself might be strong enough to overcome and to move forward in the relationship? ; Therapist: Or, you know, tell me a little bit about what your thoughts are with that. ; Patient: Well, I'm hopeful that we could resolve the issues that we're having, and although at the moment I feel like I need to break away from him, if he was able to get the support that he needed and we were able to get the support together, I think that I would be willing to give the marriage an opportunity to continue and to resolve our issues. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Julie, in terms of your own support, you mentioned your mum's looking after the children today. ; Therapist: Do you... Would you consider yourself to have friends and family that you... ; Therapist: You know, have you spoken to anyone else about this issue? ; Patient: Well, I have. ; Patient: I spoke to my girlfriend who recommended your service, and she's a very good support to me and to the children. ; Patient: And I have a very supportive family network as well. ; Patient: I have sisters who live in Sydney and also my mum, so they're all around me and they're very, very caring towards me. ; Therapist: Have any of those... ; Therapist: Any of the family or friends noticed a change in your husband's behaviour? ; Patient: Yes, they have. ; Patient: Actually, recently we had a social function and my brother did comment to me on how much alcohol my husband consumed at this social event. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So this is impacting on you as well as the, I guess, the extended family as well. ; Therapist: Well, it's really good to hear that you do have a support network outside of this room, I guess, which is really, really good. ; Therapist: And it's great that you've got that, and I'd encourage you to use your mum and your family and friends, you know, as a gentle ear to listen, to, you know, to help you support yourself and the children through this phase or this stage in your relationship with your husband. ; Therapist: So, Julie, I'm just trying to think about potentially... ; Therapist: Just to recap, so you're saying that your relationship with your husband has changed from what it was. ; Therapist: You've been with him for about eight years and you have got three children. ; Therapist: You've mentioned that the primary changes his behaviour and that you believe that it probably is linked to his change in drinking habits. ; Patient: That's right. ; Therapist: And from what I understand, you've expressed that you would be happy to potentially work with him to resolve or seek help for him in relation to his drinking habits. ; Therapist: How old do you... Would that be right in what I've said there? ; Patient: Yes, that's right. ; Patient: That's correct. ; Patient: I would be happy to work on things if he was willing to do that as well. ; Therapist: Not knowing your husband, I guess I would probably need to ask you if... ; Therapist: Do you think that your husband would be receptive to maybe some marriage counselling or going to see somebody about his drinking? ; Therapist: Is he the type of person that might be receptive to that or...? ; Patient: I think he would. ; Patient: I think if I was able to approach him when he was calm and relaxed, I think that, yes, he probably would be receptive to that. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: That's positive. ; Therapist: That's really good, because some people that I meet, you know, the answer to that would be quite different. ; Therapist: So I think that's really positive for you, Julie. ; Therapist: I think what we probably need to look at now is maybe continuing this relationship between you and I. ; Therapist: So I'd love to see you again and meet up with you again. ; Therapist: But also, too, I think we probably need to explore that avenue of either getting you some marriage counselling or something along those lines, as well as seeing whether or not your husband might be interested in looking at some services to help him with his drinking issues that he has. ; Therapist: So if it's OK by you, what we might do from here is organise for us to meet again. ; Therapist: What time is best for you? ; Patient: Around this time is a good time for me, and any Thursday or Friday during the day is good. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So what we'll do is we'll organise maybe for this time next week, and we'll meet again. ; Therapist: But in the meantime, I think we probably need to put you in contact with a relationships counsellor, and we'll try to get that side of things going. ; Therapist: And as a result of that, we'll be able to work out how receptive your husband is of potentially seeking some help for him as well. ; Therapist: I would like to just say that you mentioned that you probably would like to escape a little bit from it at the moment. ; Therapist: So perhaps I might be able to give you some advice or some information on some things that you might be able to do to take yourself away from that situation. ; Therapist: If you feel as if it's a little bit too much, maybe you might like to tap into your mum or your family and friends as well if you don't feel comfortable using some of the other services in the area. ; Therapist: How do you feel about that? ; Patient: That would be good. ; Patient: I'd appreciate that. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Well, thank you, Julie, for taking the time. ; Therapist: I'm really happy that you were able to come in today, and I look forward to going on this journey with you. ; Therapist: It's not a solution. ; Therapist: We can't fix everything here today. ; Therapist: It will be a process. ; Therapist: But hopefully together we can see a really positive outcome for you and your family. ; Patient: Thank you very much for talking to me today. ; Patient: That's been great. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: And I look forward to seeing you next week. ; Patient: Thank you very much.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Alright, so let's, if we could, let's rank those two things. ; Therapist: Right, so one is everyone is judging me. ; Therapist: They saw how I was. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And the other is a poor grade. ; Therapist: Which one is a larger fear for you? ; Patient: I would say maybe like judging. ; Therapist: Okay, so the grade's a concern. ; Patient: Yeah, but I figure I could do better on the subsequent one. ; Patient: But when people have this opinion of you, I feel like that doesn't go away as quickly. ; Therapist: Alright, um, and what would it mean if they, they thought you were anxious during that presentation? ; Patient: I guess I worry that they would think I'm anxious because I don't know what I'm doing or I don't belong there. ; Therapist: Okay, I don't belong there. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So if they notice you were anxiety, then they think you don't belong at that level. ; Patient: Yeah, like I don't deserve to be in that program. ; Therapist: I don't deserve to be in that program. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If they don't recognize those symptoms, they wouldn't think that, but if they do, that's ; Therapist: what they might think. ; Patient: Right, like maybe they think that's why I'm anxious or that's why I'm not doing well. ; Therapist: Well, how do you feel about your abilities and status in the program you're in? ; Patient: I think, you know, typically I'm one of the top students in my program and I seem to get the concepts pretty well. ; Patient: It's just when I have to demonstrate those concepts or demonstrate via like a presentation or something that I'm worried that, you know, maybe I'm an imposter or something. ; Patient: But, so I start to question myself. ; Patient: But I think in general that, you know, I'm a pretty good student before this and I'm doing pretty well in the program. ; Therapist: Alright, so you're a good student. ; Therapist: You recognize that. ; Therapist: You have this one area where you don't feel like you do a great job. ; Therapist: That's presentations. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But in terms of grade, you really only had one bad presentation. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But grades aside, you're anxious and you're worried your classmates are going to pick ; Therapist: up on that. ; Patient: Yeah, exactly. ; Therapist: Okay, so if they thought you were, you used the word imposter. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So if they thought you were an imposter, let's just say that that was something they actually believed because of what's been happening. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What would that mean? ; Therapist: What would it mean to you if your classmates thought you were an imposter? ; Patient: Um, I don't know. ; Patient: Maybe I am. ; Patient: Maybe I don't deserve to be there. ; Therapist: I don't deserve to be there. ; Patient: Yeah, like maybe I shouldn't be in this program. ; Patient: Like maybe I should just drop out. ; Therapist: Alright, so if they believe, if they believe you're an imposter based on these physical symptoms and anxiety. ; Therapist: Maybe that means to you anyway, maybe that means you shouldn't, you are an imposter, you shouldn't be there. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What's it, what's it feel like to say that? ; Patient: Depressing. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I feel like I've worked really hard, you know, to get through, you know, at least halfway through my program and it really hurts to think that that would be true. ; Therapist: To think this whole time you've really been, you've been faking it. ; Therapist: You don't really belong there. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, I'd like to move a little bit into evaluating evidence if that's okay. ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: So in cognitive therapy we like to look at what's, you know, what we're feeling and what we're thinking and what's, what we can see, what's observable around us and, you know, that becomes evidence and then we analyze it, evaluate it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You're worried at some level, you're worried that you don't deserve to be where you are right now. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: That you're not good enough to be a student in this program. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What evidence supports that belief that you're not good enough? ; Patient: Now that I'm thinking about it here, I mean, there's not a ton to support it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: But in, on that day I can think of all sorts of, you know, things to tell myself. ; Therapist: Well, let's go there then on that day. ; Patient: So maybe like, I'm not, because I'm not prepared or because I'm messing up on, on the presentation that I'm going to get a bad grade and, you know, if I can't, if I can't speak in front of people, how am I going to speak in front of kids as a teacher, you know, one day that it will translate to something else. ; Patient: Like if I can't get past this. ; Therapist: So even if I survive the program somehow I might be bad at my job. ; Patient: Yeah.",

; Patient: I'm alright. ; Therapist: You're alright? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: I understand that you've come to counseling because you have a particular issue that's been bothering you recently. ; Patient: Yeah, I've been really stressed out at work. ; Patient: I'm getting to the point where it's really hard to handle things that are going on. ; Therapist: So work-related problems. ; Therapist: Are you okay talking about that today? ; Patient: I think I need to, yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So what I'd like to do in the beginning is kind of set a plan for our meeting today. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we can move off that plan if we need to, but I'd just like to start with that and give us some structure to what we'll be doing. ; Therapist: So first, and this is something I want to co-create with you, right? ; Therapist: So your input is extremely valuable to it. ; Therapist: I don't want to just lay it out and we follow it. ; Therapist: I want you to be an active part of putting this together. ; Therapist: So as I throw out some ideas, let me know if it's something that makes sense to you ; Therapist: or doesn't. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I'd like to start by having you explain in depth kind of what you're going through at work. ; Therapist: And I want to hear that story. ; Therapist: Then I'm going to look for some patterns in the way you're thinking and see if there's something that I recognize and all that, something I can point out that may help you a bit. ; Therapist: And we'll get more to that later. ; Therapist: And then to kind of, as we wrap up, move toward the end, maybe start getting some ideas of things you can do between sessions, between now and when I see you next time, that can help combat these symptoms, make you feel a little better. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that seem like a fairly straightforward agenda? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any changes or anything you'd like to make to that? ; Patient: No, I think as long as you think I can tell my whole story in enough time. ; Therapist: Well, we'll see. ; Therapist: We'll see. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You just kind of tell me what's going on as you feel comfortable. ; Therapist: And don't worry about the agenda, but just know that overall that's kind of what I'm thinking about for the structure. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And then as we wrap up, we'll set to make an appointment next time. ; Therapist: And like I said, we'll end up with some ideas. ; Therapist: I hope they can help you. ; Therapist: So let's get started with kind of your experience with all this. ; Therapist: So tell me about your job. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: So I'm a caseworker and, you know, what I do, I usually go into people's homes and, you know, talk to the families, do inspections, that kind of thing. ; Patient: And, you know, I've been doing it for a while now, not too long, but about five years. ; Patient: And overall, I like my job and everything. ; Patient: But just, you know, something happened at work and it just really kind of, I just feel like one minute everything was fine and now it just feels like everything's really out of control. ; Patient: So, you know, I was just, you know, doing my normal job, making reports and everything like that. ; Patient: And, you know, I made a report about this family that I felt, you know, maybe the children weren't getting quite what they needed. ; Patient: They seemed malnourished. ; Patient: The house was really unclean. ; Patient: You know, I suspected that the parents were using drugs there and it's just really not a good environment. ; Patient: And, you know, it turns out that the kids were taken away and, you know, the family, it just, I'm like really freaked out, you know, maybe the kids aren't doing well. ; Patient: They're away from their parents. ; Patient: Even though it wasn't a great environment, I know that the kids really love their parents and it's just, it's really, really weighing on me. ; Patient: And it's become kind of like a really big issue at work, I guess, where like everybody knows about it and, you know, I just feel like I tore this family apart and I don't know if I made the right decision and I just, it's like, you know, I used to just, I used to be so confident in what I did and now I just feel like I'm second guessing everything. ; Therapist: So this is really stressful on you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, you like, so I make sure I understand, you like your job, but this, this dealing you've had with this particular family and what happened as a result of that dealing has just really thrown you for a loop. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's making me not like my job. ; Patient: Like I wake up in the morning and I'm like, I should just pretend I'm sick. ; Patient: I don't want to go, you know, I just feel like, you know, at night I'm more stressed out, you know, maybe I have an extra glass of wine and I just feel so on edge all the time. ; Therapist: So it's really drastically changed your work experience. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I used to enjoy going to work and, you know, feel fulfilled and now I just feel like I do not want to go at all. ; Therapist: So there's a sense of dread, anxiety. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you feel down at all? ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Patient: I think anxiety more so, but I definitely feel down. ; Patient: Like, you know, even on the weekends, sometimes I just wake up and I want to stay in bed and, you know, I just, I feel like I'm having a good time and then I remember what happened and it just brings me back to that place and I'm just, I don't like it. ; Therapist: It's not a good feeling. ; Patient: No.",

; Therapist: I'm okay. ; Patient: Are you okay? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I know when we met last time for your intake, you were concerned about some presentations that you had to give at school. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Patient: Do you want to talk about that today? ; Therapist: Yeah, so in school, I am in school for teaching, and we have to give presentations a lot, as you can imagine, on different things. ; Therapist: And so, it's something that's recurring. ; Therapist: And what happened was, I gave a really bad one one time. ; Patient: A bad presentation? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I wasn't feeling very well, and I gave, I think I was just really tired from studying all night, and I gave a really bad presentation. ; Therapist: And then, like now, ever since, like when I've tried to give subsequent presentations, I am just so nervous, and I'm up there like sweating, and like starting to forget what I'm going to say. ; Therapist: And I'm just like a fear of getting up there and having to get a presentation, because I feel like I'm going to vomit. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: So was there a time before, like recently, when you had to give presentations? ; Therapist: Yeah, I mean like before and earlier in my, like I'm towards the end of my degree, so throughout my program I have, I have a lot to do. ; Patient: And how did you do with those? ; Therapist: Pretty well. ; Therapist: I mean, I consider myself a pretty good student, so normally I do pretty well. ; Therapist: It seemed to come out of nowhere. ; Patient: So this presentation that you gave with the, where you received a poor score, maybe just an isolated incident? ; Therapist: Yeah, like I was saying, I wasn't, I wasn't feeling very well, I don't think, and it really hasn't happened. ; Patient: But that experience has still led to a lot of anxiety with subsequent presentations. ; Therapist: Oh yeah. ; Therapist: Like I'm worried about my grades suffering as a result and, you know, how well I'm going to do. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: So, would it be okay if we kind of step through the whole process of you giving a presentation? ; Therapist: Yeah, sure. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Is, before I start with that, is this something that leads to anxiety, like right now or other times or really just in that moment when you're presenting? ; Therapist: Mostly it's most intense in that moment and like maybe like leading up to it, like in preparation that I know that this is going to happen. ; Therapist: Like I always know when I'm going to present, like it'll be like, she'll, the teacher will say, oh, well, you know, you're this Thursday, someone else's next Thursday. ; Therapist: So the closer it gets to that event, the more anxious I am, like in anticipation. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: So you start feeling anxiety a few days before presentation or? ; Therapist: Yeah, I would say a few days mostly. ; Patient: When does it start to get really distressing for you? ; Therapist: Like two days before or one day before. ; Therapist: Then I'm like, oh my gosh, like, am I ready? ; Therapist: Like what if I mess up? ; Therapist: You know, what if I get a bad grade? ; Therapist: All these like what ifs. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: So, would it be okay if we step into this process and kind of break down the steps of the presentation? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: So let's say that you're taking, what's one of the classes you're taking now? ; Therapist: Early childhood. ; Patient: Early childhood. ; Patient: So let's say you have a presentation in that class a few days from now. ; Patient: It's just a normal presentation. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: So let's now move to two days out. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Where you would start to feel a little anxiety about it. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: What's going through your mind at that two day out point? ; Therapist: I would say like, am I prepared enough? ; Therapist: Like did I do enough, you know, to study or to write down? ; Therapist: Did I do enough? ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: So your thought is, did I do enough preparation? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Which leads to maybe I didn't is what I'm really thinking. ; Therapist: Like I'm not prepared enough as I should be. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I'm not prepared. ; Patient: I'm not prepared enough. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: So that's the thought you're having about 48 hours before the presentation. ; Patient: I'm not prepared enough. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: So kind of thinking about that thought and what happens afterward, do you have a reaction like any type of emotional affective, we call it affective reaction to that? ; Therapist: So at that point I'm usually like more like anxious, maybe like irritable a little bit, um, mostly. ; Patient: And that goes substantially unchanged, that feeling for how long? ; Therapist: Um, like the day before it like kind of gets more intense when I'm like nitpicking like, well, I forgot this or I didn't forget this. ; Therapist: And you know, remembering what happened last time when I didn't do so well and worrying about my grade, like more thoughts pop in my head of things that I forgot or what if sort of things. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: So the same type of thought, just more intense. ; Therapist: More intense. ; Patient: And the feeling is also more intense. ; Therapist: Yes.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, I'm Jordan. ; Therapist: It's so nice to meet you. ; Patient: Hi, I'm Judy. ; Therapist: How are you doing? ; Patient: I'm pretty good. ; Therapist: Well welcome, sit down. ; Therapist: Have you ever been to a counseling session before? ; Patient: No, this will be my first time. ; Therapist: Well okay then, so just a little bit about us. ; Therapist: We're a counseling center and we work with people with a range of different things going on with them. ; Therapist: And between the two of us we can work through whatever is going on with you in your life. ; Therapist: But before we begin, I just wanted to let you know that everything you say here is confidential. ; Therapist: Unless you're intending to harm yourself or other people and then we're obligated to report it for their own safety. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yeah, that makes sense too. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So I also just want to forewarn you, today is going to be a lot of questions. ; Therapist: Just trying to get some background of where you're at and where you want to go. ; Therapist: Also, would it be okay with you if I write down some things as we talk? ; Patient: Yeah, that's totally fine. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So to begin, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? ; Patient: Yeah, like I said, my name is Judy. ; Patient: I'm 42. ; Patient: I have two kids. ; Patient: Max, who's eight years old, and Chelsea, who is six. ; Patient: Max plays soccer. ; Patient: He's very active around the home. ; Patient: Like almost too active. ; Patient: And Chelsea is a little know-all, but keeps me in line. ; Patient: And kids are both very active, pretty good in school, get along pretty well, and they're good. ; Patient: They're good kids. ; Patient: Sweet kids. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: I'm so glad. ; Therapist: So I'd love to hear what's been going on from your perspective and why you're excited to come here today. ; Patient: Well, I have a lot of negative stuff going on in my life right now. ; Patient: I've been very stressed lately because I lost my job pretty recently. ; Patient: It was a rough time and I haven't been handling it very well according to my husband. ; Patient: And he told me that I had to come to counseling where he would leave me. ; Patient: So that's why I'm here. ; Therapist: I'm definitely glad that you came. ; Therapist: When did you notice this change in yourself or notice that this was a problem? ; Patient: Well, I lost my job about a month ago. ; Patient: I got laid off a month ago. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it seems like losing your job has really affected your relationship with your husband and family. ; Therapist: You said you have two other kids, that you love with them, right? ; Patient: Yes, I have two kids Max and Chelsea. ; Patient: I love them a lot and we live all together, the four of us. ; Patient: The children are wonderful, but I feel like I haven't been a great mom recently to them or my husband. ; Patient: I think that's unfair to me. ; Therapist: So that leads great into my next question. ; Therapist: What's your relationship with your husband like? ; Patient: Well, we've had our ups and downs like every marriage. ; Patient: I spend a lot of time with the kids. ; Patient: He works a lot. ; Patient: He's not very close with the kids. ; Patient: But I'm not as close with my parents. ; Patient: I'm very close with my mom. ; Patient: And she's been there for me a lot in the past. ; Therapist: Interesting. ; Therapist: And how long have you been married for? ; Patient: Just seven years. ; Therapist: And what do you like to do in your free time with your family? ; Therapist: Do you spend time with them? ; Patient: Yeah, I go to the gym a lot. ; Patient: That's more of an individual activity for me. ; Patient: It's something that releases a lot of my stress. ; Patient: And that's kind of how I, I don't know, it's part of who I am. ; Patient: But with the kids, I like them and I drive them all over the place all the time. ; Patient: I like to practice, I like to practice everything. ; Patient: So there's not a lot of time for me to really have time with my kids. ; Patient: But I don't know, I like to, you know, we read together every night. ; Patient: I try to make time for the kids. ; Patient: And I take them to the beach when it's warm. ; Patient: You know, there's a lot of things that we do together. ; Therapist: Good, good. ; Therapist: Do you find you can draw support from your family? ; Therapist: You mentioned your aunt, but... ; Patient: Well, I don't really want to warn the kids because they think they're so young. ; Patient: And I think they know that something's up, but I don't really know to what extent they know. ; Patient: But I am closer to my aunt. ; Patient: She's always been there for me. ; Patient: But my husband and I have had a rough patch recently since I lost my job. ; Therapist: So, when you're stressed, you sometimes go to your aunt, but do you turn to people for comfort? ; Therapist: Or do you have an activity that helps you calm down or another method that helps you cope? ; Patient: Like I said, I have been going to the gym a lot, but I haven't been doing that as much recently. ; Patient: Maybe, I'm not really sure why I haven't made time for it. ; Patient: I haven't really felt like myself recently. ; Patient: But a lot of times, I turn to other things more than people. ; Therapist: What kind of things do you mean? ; Therapist: Like substances, drugs and alcohol? ; Patient: Yeah, I've never used them before, but I feel like it helps me relax, calm down. ; Patient: And a lot of times, it's something that I feel like I need to be, I guess, relaxed. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you find that's affecting your family? ; Therapist: Your relationships with them or the way you interact? ; Patient: It didn't for a while. ; Patient: But like I said, about a month ago was a turning point. ; Patient: And when I lost my job, I do feel very ashamed. ; Patient: I made a horrible mistake the other day. ; Patient: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I drove with them in the car after I had a few drinks and they got pulled over. ; Patient: I felt like I endangered my family. ; Patient: I felt like I was being a bad mom and that was a really big life to me. ; Therapist: That must have been pretty scary for you. ; Therapist: But if you think of it this way, it could be a turning point. ; Therapist: And you now notice what you're doing wrong and how you can improve it. ; Therapist: So it's progress that you're admitting that and that you do need to improve on certain things. ; Therapist: Do you take any other medications? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What medications? ; Patient: Oxycodone. ; Therapist: And why do you have a prescription for that? ; Patient: Well, I had surgery a few years back and I got fulfilled. ; Patient: I didn't really finish all the pills, but I've been taking them recently when I feel like I need to. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And how often do you take them? ; Patient: I've taken three over the course of a month, but I know that I shouldn't be. ; Therapist: How do you feel when you take them? ; Patient: It's numbing and it allows me to relax and escape from the issues in the home and workplace. ; Patient: I guess not really a workplace anymore, but I know that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing and I know that it's wrong. ; Patient: And I guess that's why I'm here. ; Therapist: How has your family ever had a history of drug abuse problems and drinking? ; Patient: My dad, I think, was an alcoholic for a while, not really diagnosed. ; Patient: I grew up with a lot of that in the home. ; Patient: A lot of just genuine parents didn't mesh too well or a lot of infighting in the home. ; Patient: And the older I get, the more that I think that it might have been alcohol related on my father's part. ; Patient: My mother definitely not. ; Patient: My father though, and I believe that his father had a problem similar to that as well. ; Therapist: And is it the first time you found yourself turning to it? ; Patient: A few times in college I found myself depressed, confused about growing up, getting a career. ; Patient: I wasn't an addict in college, but I would do things with the intention of feeling better and forgetting. ; Patient: I think that's kind of something that's been beneath the surface for a while. ; Patient: When I find myself stressful, I can sink back into that. ; Therapist: Have you ever experienced any form of sexual assault or abuse that maybe made you turn to alcohol? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Are you having trouble eating or sleeping? ; Patient: Eating, yeah, not as much or as healthy as I have before, but sleeping absolutely because of stress. ; Patient: I find myself not sleeping as well. ; Therapist: Yeah, that definitely happens with stress. ; Therapist: And what's a typical day like for you? ; Patient: Well, lately my husband's been taking care of the kids more because of last week and the incident with getting pulled over. ; Patient: He doesn't trust me with the kids, which I guess they understand. ; Patient: He doesn't trust me to drive kids places because of last week, so he usually will take them to school and I'll make him late for work and that makes him upset. ; Patient: And there's an argument there. ; Patient: When I wake up, I'll have a drink, so I'm not too hung up from the night before. ; Patient: Then I watch my show, I get the mail, and usually there's a bill, so I have a few more drinks. ; Patient: And then I try to start dinner, but it's usually hard because I'm pretty intoxicated, but I start dinner and usually at the night is the letter of a shit show and the kids are frustrated and you figure it out. ; Therapist: And are you feeling sad or down in addition to being stressed? ; Patient: I'm pretty sad. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And when you're sad, do you turn to your faith? ; Therapist: Have you been praying a lot? ; Patient: Some I used to, but I don't as much anymore. ; Patient: It's hard to believe that somebody's watching over me with all this negative stuff. ; Therapist: Does other things give you hope besides your faith? ; Patient: The kids. ; Patient: Watching them play together and be together really gives me a lot of hope. ; Patient: I love seeing them do what they love to do and I love it when I know that what I do can enable them to enjoy their activities. ; Patient: But it's been hard to do that recently because I drive them to school, I've been taking them to activities because my husband's been doing this for me. ; Patient: So it's getting kind of empty-fills with them getting into the family. ; Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. ; Therapist: So we can start to meet on a regular basis and try to work through all these things together. ; Therapist: From what I've collected, from what you kind of just told me, you're really stressed about losing your job and so you want to find different ways to cope with your stress. ; Therapist: And then also try to rebuild the trust in your family, with your husband, your kids that they may have lost during the driving incident last week. ; Patient: Sounds a lot like what I want to do. ; Patient: I hope that you're able to help me with that. ; Therapist: So in order for this to be most effective, let's brainstorm some small steps we can work on. ; Therapist: Maybe make a list together and it can be very small unless it's not too overwhelming at first. ; Therapist: So for instance, to work on the drinking thing, we can start by cutting down the number of drinks slowly today. ; Therapist: And it can be really hard to just stop cold turkey because you can get withdrawal symptoms or it may make you even more stressed out. ; Therapist: So I want you to be able to be confident in the goal you're setting and in yourself. ; Therapist: So can you do one last drink each day or something like that. ; Therapist: So what would you like to achieve from our work together in the future, by the end? ; Patient: Yeah, I hear what you're saying. ; Patient: I understand. ; Patient: I guess I don't want to stop moving completely. ; Patient: But it sounds like a very logical solution at this point. ; Patient: It doesn't sound like something I'd be able to do at this point immediately. ; Patient: We can maybe get there. ; Patient: I'm not really sure if we can completely get there. ; Patient: And then after that, I'd really like to fix my relationship with my family. ; Patient: So if I go to my husband, we can patch things with my parents too. ; Therapist: So let's start with a goal regarding drinking. ; Therapist: What do you think is a reasonable thing for yourself? ; Patient: I can start having four drinks a day, maybe four maybe. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: That's a good one. ; Therapist: Then in a few days you can try having three, and two, and one, until you don't need to turn to alcohol for comfort, and so on and so forth. ; Therapist: If you need a different way to find comfort, you can try stress relieving activities. ; Therapist: So what would be a good activity for you to do? ; Patient: I think I could try journaling, maybe drawing or painting. ; Patient: I did a lot of art in college. ; Patient: I'd really like to get back into that and I would just call it a day. ; Therapist: That's a really great idea. ; Therapist: Then in the future, what are you thinking regarding your career? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I don't think anyone's going to want somebody as dressed up as me right now. ; Patient: What was your old job again? ; Patient: I was a staff captain. ; Therapist: Well, you don't need to jump right back into work again. ; Therapist: That can be a way in the future, or maybe a month or two. ; Therapist: If you think about it in the future, what would be your goal? ; Patient: I guess I'd like to get back in the game, but I think more important for me is that I patch things up with my family. ; Patient: But I do need to try making money again to support the family. ; Patient: It's not logical for me to assume that I can go a long time without it. ; Patient: That's why I want to fix my issues, get back in the job, and see what I can do. ; Therapist: What kind of things do you think could help rebuild the trust within your family? ; Patient: I could block out some time each week to really spend a long time with each of my family members, my kids and my husband. ; Patient: Kids I don't think really understand what's going on, so I don't have to work as hard with them, but I would still love to. ; Patient: I just really do need to work in relationship with my husband, go back to what things we used to do together, and see what we can do to get back there. ; Therapist: A way you could do that is try family therapy or couples counseling. ; Therapist: Would you be interested in something like that? ; Patient: Yeah, that's definitely something we could do. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So, I'm very happy that you came to talk to me today. ; Therapist: From what I heard, it sounds like losing your job has been incredibly stressful for you. ; Therapist: And you turned to substance abuse to try and relieve some of that stress. ; Therapist: Do you feel a little bit better after talking to me? ; Patient: I absolutely do. ; Patient: I feel like the weight has really been lifted off my shoulders, and the fact that somebody is going to be in charge of my recovery, I think is huge. ; Therapist: We'll definitely be working hand in hand, so you're in charge of your recovery, but I'm definitely here to help you along the way. ; Therapist: I really am looking forward to our next session together. ; Therapist: Me too. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So, until our next session, I want you to try and journal every time that you're feeling upset or like you need to drink, stress, and then bring your journal and we can go through and find the times you felt like you needed substance to help you. ; Therapist: And in addition to that, maybe try and cut back on your drinking, maybe one less glass or something of wine or anything for now. ; Therapist: And then next time, let me know how that goes. ; Patient: Yeah, I can totally make sure of that. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So, I want you to know that I really do believe in you and that you can get through this. ; Therapist: And if you continue to come to our sessions, we really can work together to accomplish these goals that we just discussed. ; Patient: Thanks. ; Patient: I hope so too. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Have a good day. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: I just want to change gears again. ; Therapist: I want to talk about any potential trauma or abuse. ; Therapist: Are you comfortable with that topic? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You mentioned earlier there's been no occasions where you've had nonconsensual sexual contact. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: What about physical abuse? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How about emotional abuse? ; Patient: I don't know if it really counts as emotional abuse. ; Therapist: Well tell me. ; Patient: My dad can be really intense about things and when you don't necessarily meet his expectations or bring home the grade he was expecting or if you're not as successful as your sister, he can be kind of harsh. ; Therapist: Can you give me an example of something he might have said? ; Patient: Like why can't you ever be good enough or don't tell people you're my daughter when you go out in public or I wish we had two of your sisters and didn't have you or they also switched you at the hospital because you couldn't possibly be part of this family, that sort of thing. ; Therapist: Fairly strong statements. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What's that feel like when he says things like that? ; Patient: I guess now I'm used to it. ; Patient: Before it was terrible but you just kind of grow numb to stuff like that. ; Therapist: You feel like you're numb to it now? ; Patient: I've heard it enough that I know it's coming so you just kind of get used to it. ; Therapist: Still got to be a little bit painful? ; Patient: Yeah, it is. ; Patient: But you can only hear things so many times before it's like alright well you're hearing the same stuff. ; Therapist: Is there ever been a change in your anxiety levels or your drinking when you would make comments like that? ; Patient: I think sometimes if he got off on a tangent or whatever and got really insulting. ; Patient: Generally I would need to blow some steam and I'd go out with my friends or whatever and I think that's when it started to get into the heavier drinking during that time because I would get anxious and stressed out and not thinking clearly. ; Therapist: Would you consider this a significant part of your history? ; Patient: I guess so. ; Therapist: I mean it seems a little upsetting to you to say the least. ; Patient: Yeah, it is. ; Therapist: Something maybe we can talk about later? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So I want to switch gears again a little bit. ; Therapist: What do you do for fun for recreation? ; Patient: Other than partying? ; Therapist: Well, okay, I'll put that in there. ; Therapist: Partying, that's one thing. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay, yeah. ; Therapist: So other than that? ; Patient: I like to shop. ; Therapist: Like to shop? ; Patient: And I like to hike. ; Patient: I like the mountains. ; Therapist: Hiking? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: When was the last time you were hiking? ; Patient: Two years ago. ; Patient: It's been a while. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What else? ; Patient: I like being out with my friends. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Or, um, like going to see live shows, like music stuff. ; Therapist: Okay, live shows? ; Therapist: Like theater or? ; Patient: Like music. ; Patient: Like bands and stuff. ; Therapist: Oh, okay. ; Therapist: Like music. ; Therapist: When was the last time you've done that? ; Patient: Probably a year. ; Therapist: A year. ; Therapist: Do you consider your life to be fun? ; Patient: Not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Has it ever been? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I can think of instances that were fun. ; Patient: I don't know if I would call my entire life situation fun. ; Therapist: When was the last instance that you could remember? ; Patient: Like when I go out with my friends and blow up steam. ; Patient: That's fun. ; Therapist: So these little moments here and there. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But consistently, not the case. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I want to switch gears again and ask you about any type of, or any time in your life when you may have had suicidal thoughts or behaviors. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a time when you contemplated suicide? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Never? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And right now, it's not something you're thinking about? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: What do you think has protected you against having any type of suicidal thoughts? ; Patient: I want to succeed. ; Patient: I want to do more. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Now how about harm to others? ; Therapist: Have you thought about harming someone else? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Never? ; Therapist: What do you think protects you against that? ; Patient: I think I'm definitely a nice person. ; Therapist: Nice person? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you ever get angry? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Who doesn't? ; Therapist: But it's never translated to anything where you've had any desire to hurt anybody? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: So you deal with anger pretty well? ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Again, some of these questions, I'm aware probably don't apply, but I want to go through them just in case. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Has there ever been a time where you heard or saw something that other people did not hear or see? ; Patient: Like a hallucination? ; Therapist: Like a hallucination. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Other than perhaps under the influence of alcohol, was there ever a time you felt out of touch with reality? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How would you describe your judgment when making decisions? ; Patient: When I'm sober or when I am? ; Therapist: When you're sober. ; Patient: I think it's pretty good. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Good judgment? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, my anxiety plays into it a little bit. ; Patient: But I think generally it's good. ; Therapist: And when you're under the influence? ; Patient: Not as good. ; Therapist: Not as good? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Any questions for me so far? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I've been asking a lot of questions, huh? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I know. ; Therapist: We're almost through. ; Therapist: I appreciate you bearing with me. ; Therapist: I'd like to talk about your goals. ; Therapist: And I want to talk about on two levels. ; Therapist: So your goals in life. ; Therapist: So these are like your general goals. ; Therapist: And then your specific goals for your time with me. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: So let's start with your general goals for your life. ; Therapist: What would you like? ; Patient: I want to get a job when I graduate. ; Patient: And I want to be self-sufficient. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I like to not be so worried all the time. ; Patient: Just be kind of more at ease in general. ; Patient: Maybe get my own apartment, live on my own, that type of thing. ; Therapist: Live on your own? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Any other life goals? ; Therapist: Any goals surrounding family or anything like that? ; Patient: Maybe figure out how to communicate better with them, I guess. ; Therapist: How about having your own family? ; Patient: Yeah, for sure. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If you think of any other goals later on, or answers to these questions of any nature, feel free to just add that in. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So we can go back and edit this and add to it. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about goals for treatment? ; Patient: The drinking is one. ; Patient: The anxiety. ; Therapist: Anxiety. ; Patient: Maybe try to graduate. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Graduating college? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What was that last part? ; Patient: Just getting through the last year. ; Therapist: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: Surviving the last year of college. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Drinking, anxiety, graduating college. ; Therapist: Anything else that would be a goal of therapy? ; Patient: I think those are the big ones I'm really concerned about. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So if you could meet those three goals, you feel like the counseling would have been successful? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So one last area I want to cover with you. ; Therapist: What do you consider your strengths that are going to help you to meet these goals and to meet your life goals? ; Patient: I think I'm ready now. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You're ready? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: What else? ; Patient: I think I'm dedicated to getting better and dedicated to the future that I want. ; Patient: I'm a hard worker. ; Patient: I don't know that I would have made it this far if I wasn't despite everything else. ; Therapist: Hard worker. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: What do you think I'm pretty understanding? ; Therapist: Understanding? ; Therapist: How about intelligent? ; Patient: I guess so. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You guess so? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I never really thought about it. ; Therapist: Never thought about it. ; Therapist: How about social skills? ; Patient: I think I'm good at maintaining my friendships. ; Therapist: Do you think about the future a lot? ; Therapist: What your future is going to be like? ; Patient: Sometimes. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how does it look to you right now? ; Patient: Not the way I want it to look. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, we'll try to work on that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Are there any other questions that you want to ask me before we wrap up intake? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Patient: That was a lot. ; Therapist: What's that? ; Patient: That was a lot. ; Therapist: That was a lot. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: We did cover a lot. ; Therapist: As I mentioned, if you have any other questions about this at any time, we can come back to revisit this. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: We can add on to it. ; Therapist: And likely as we go through the sessions, I'll have even more questions. ; Therapist: Maybe not as intensely packaged all at one time like this was, but I'll have more questions for you. ; Therapist: And I appreciate you answering the questions. ; Therapist: I know some of them are probably a bit challenging to talk about. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So I'm going to finish this up, and I'm going to get you scheduled to see it in about a week. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's all I have for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Of course. ; Therapist: And we'll get started with the counseling sessions. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right, Sam. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks.",
