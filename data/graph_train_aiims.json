; Therapist: I understand there have been some difficulties lately that brought you into the agency. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Tell me what's going on. ; Patient: About a week ago, I went out with some friends to a boxing match. ; Patient: I didn't really want to go. ; Patient: I've never really been to one. ; Patient: It's not really something I'm interested in. ; Patient: But I went just to hang out with my friends and stuff. ; Patient: I watched a few fights, and this one fight, this guy, nothing was really happening. ; Patient: I wasn't really into it, but this guy got knocked out right in front of me. ; Patient: It was really close to the ring. ; Patient: He got knocked out right in front of me, fell right on his face, and I just saw him lifeless in front of me. ; Patient: And I just ever since then, it's happened the same. ; Patient: I had to leave right away. ; Patient: I just couldn't be there anymore. ; Therapist: What did you notice right away? ; Patient: One of the boxers was knocked out. ; Therapist: You saw that. ; Therapist: What did you notice right away that was happening? ; Patient: I just felt really, really scared. ; Patient: My heart started racing. ; Patient: I couldn't focus on what was going on around me. ; Patient: I just had to get out of there. ; Patient: So I don't even really know what happened to him, if he was okay or not. ; Patient: So I just couldn't handle how I was feeling, so I had to leave. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you left, and the symptoms, they continued? ; Patient: Yeah, pretty much daily for the past week. ; Patient: I got home that night. ; Patient: I couldn't sleep. ; Patient: It took me almost all night to fall asleep. ; Patient: And then at work on Monday, I was having a lot of problems there. ; Therapist: What kind of problems? ; Patient: I couldn't focus when anyone was talking to me. ; Patient: I had a meeting on Tuesday, and my boss was talking for a while. ; Patient: I felt like I couldn't concentrate at all. ; Patient: Everything was just a blur around me. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you find that you're having memories of the incident at the boxing match that are intrusive? ; Patient: Yeah, I think about it a lot, pretty much all the time. ; Therapist: And it's bothersome for you? ; Patient: Yeah, if I'm at work trying to get some paperwork done or something, it just pops in my mind, and I can't make it go away. ; Therapist: And you try, but the memories stay there. ; Therapist: Any dreams related to the... ; Patient: No, I haven't really been dreaming about it. ; Patient: I'm barely sleeping, so... ; Therapist: Any times when you feel like you're reliving what you saw, like you're seeing it again? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Patient: I just think about it a lot. ; Therapist: You think about it? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Is anything reminding you of the boxing match, and then that's causing you to have symptoms? ; Patient: At the end of my meeting, people started clapping, you know, this big cheering, and that kind of made me feel really bad. ; Patient: Again, my heart was racing. ; Patient: I started sweating. ; Patient: It just kind of reminded me of being there, and I started thinking about it again. ; Patient: So things like that, you know, I pump up music when it comes on the radio, same kind of music they played there. ; Patient: That kind of makes me feel the same way. ; Patient: My heart starts to race. ; Patient: I just kind of feel like I need to get away from it. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself working to avoid, like, music that was similar? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I've been trying to really avoid the radio, because you never know what's going to come on on the radio. ; Patient: So I've been avoiding listening to music in case something like that happens and avoiding crowds. ; Therapist: Do you find that you've had any trouble remembering what happened? ; Patient: No, I can pretty vividly remember it. ; Therapist: It's pretty clear to you? ; Patient: Yeah, when I think about it. ; Therapist: Have you been irritable at all since the... ; Patient: Yeah, you know, just out of nowhere. ; Patient: If something doesn't go the way I want it to, I just kind of snap on people. ; Patient: And that's not like me at all. ; Patient: I usually am pretty easygoing. ; Patient: And, you know, people, my boyfriend, for instance, I yelled at him the other day for not putting the toilet paper on the roll. ; Patient: And that's not something I'd usually care about. ; Patient: It's just, it's not me. ; Therapist: How about your awareness level of what's around you? ; Therapist: Do you find that your awareness level has increased, that you're more aware? ; Patient: Um, it kind of depends. ; Patient: Sometimes I kind of feel like I'm in a daze and don't really know what's going on around me. ; Patient: But, um, I've been, um, one of the students that I work with, he popped out from behind the door, which he would do all the time. ; Patient: And, you know, typically I would laugh and think it was funny before, but he did it the other day and I just could not control myself afterwards. ; Patient: Like, I couldn't calm myself down. ; Patient: You know, I didn't think it was funny at all. ; Patient: It really, really scared me. ; Patient: And that went on for about 10, 15 minutes and I just, my heart was racing. ; Patient: I had to go take a walk. ; Patient: And it was just really hard to relax again after that. ; Therapist: So you feel like your reaction to that was stronger than it normally would have been? ; Patient: Definitely. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you used drugs or alcohol recently? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Any medical problems? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: So Jackie, I'm going to get you in to see a counselor here at the agency if that's something that you're okay with. ; Patient: Yeah, I think that would be really helpful. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Just take a couple days to get you on the, to get you in to see somebody, to get you on the schedule and get you in to see somebody. ; Therapist: And I'll get that arranged. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Patient: Thanks.",

; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Can you give me some examples? ; Patient: Like for instance, I go to the dry cleaner to pick up my fiance's uniforms and the lady had them like all bagged together and I mean I could have easily just asked her because she separate them but I began to yell causing a big commotion because I was so frustrated and angry. ; Patient: She actually was about to call the police to escort me out and I don't think I'm even allowed to go back to the dry cleaner anymore. ; Therapist: So quite a bit of anger. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: My neighbor's dog was barking late at night and I know my neighbors really can't control that but I get into a huge fight with my neighbor's argument. ; Patient: We're not speaking at the moment and it's just real uncomfortable but I mean I feel bad now that it's over with now that I thought about it and I just don't know why I was so upset that the dog was barking. ; Therapist: Alright, so from your perspective it doesn't seem to make sense why you got so angry. ; Patient: No, I just, it's been going on for some time now and I just get little things just, I just explode. ; Patient: So, I don't know why. ; Therapist: Did anything change around the time that the anger started? ; Patient: Nothing that I can really think of. ; Patient: Just when I'm overwhelmed and I have so much to do, I kind of just break down and just become extremely upset with everything around me. ; Therapist: Alright, so you're getting upset, you have some anger. ; Therapist: Any other time that you're feeling angry? ; Patient: When I go to the, I go work out at the kickboxing class, I'm like, I go all out. ; Patient: Like I use that as like a release. ; Patient: I'm punching the bags extremely hard. ; Patient: I actually had hurt my wrist last week. ; Patient: I just go all out in there and my trainer kind of notices like, are you okay? ; Patient: And I'm like, yeah, it's just relief kind of getting all the anger I had out. ; Therapist: Alright, so that experience for you, you feel like you're releasing more energy than maybe the other people in the kickboxing class. ; Patient: Yeah, way more. ; Therapist: Way more. ; Patient: I'm like loud, I'm sweating bullets, I'm just going all out, like extreme anger. ; Therapist: Alright, so the, in recent memory, your anger has increased, but it's still not really clear what's going on that's causing the anger. ; Patient: Not really, I just feel like frustrated, just have too much going on at the moment. ; Patient: So it's just kind of like, I just feel overwhelmed I guess and I take it out. ; Therapist: You feel busy, like in your daily life, like a lot of responsibilities? ; Patient: Yes, a whole lot. ; Therapist: What kind of things are you doing? ; Patient: Mainly, mainly take care of home, I don't work or anything. ; Patient: So I kind of just take care of home and you know with the kids and everything, it's just a lot. ; Therapist: Do you see a lot of responsibilities in the home? ; Patient: Yes, all of the responsibilities. ; Therapist: All of them? ; Patient: It feels like all of them. ; Therapist: What type of things are you doing? ; Patient: I'm cooking, I'm cleaning, now I have to iron all of my husband's uniforms and get everything ready for him. ; Patient: I have to make sure I cook breakfast, I have to make sure I pack lunch, I have to make sure I have dinner ready when come, I have to help the kids with their homework. ; Patient: I just have so much going on, like it's constant catering, catering, catering, catering. ; Patient: It feels like I just really don't get a break or any other help, it's just me doing everything. ; Therapist: You're doing everything? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And has it always been this way? ; Patient: Not always, but it seems, it's been like this for some time. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Were you really just doing everything in the home? ; Patient: Everything. ; Therapist: I want to ask you, I want to ask you or mention a few words, right? ; Therapist: And I would like you to, if you're okay with this exercise, tell me the first thing that comes to mind. ; Therapist: And you can, when I say a word, you can offer several responses. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But try not to invest a lot of thought into the response, but more just what occurs to you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So the first word is home. ; Patient: Structure, responsibility, repetition. ; Therapist: Repetition. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Let me give you another word, relationship. ; Patient: Conflict, power struggle, disagreements. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Let me offer you another word. ; Therapist: Work. ; Patient: Independence. ; Patient: Freedom. ; Patient: Able to express creativity. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And how about another word here? ; Therapist: Power. ; Patient: A constant struggle. ; Patient: Extremely controlling. ; Therapist: So do you see any themes in the words that you provided back? ; Patient: It just seems like everything is like really controlled and structured. ; Therapist: Controlled and structured. ; Therapist: What's the source of that control and structure? ; Therapist: Or is there a source of it? ; Patient: A lot of it may come from my fiancé, now that I'm thinking about it. ; Therapist: Tell me what you're thinking. ; Patient: Because I feel like he doesn't give me the freedom or the ability to do a lot of the things that I would like to do, like work. ; Patient: And I think he should help more with the kids around the house and do things. ; Patient: And I shouldn't have to do everything. ; Patient: And I feel like that's probably a lot of the... ; Patient: Why I'm so frustrated, because I feel that I don't have any help. ; Patient: It's like I'm single and I'm doing everything on my own. ; Patient: So that's probably where the bulk of my frustrations come from. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So as you're telling me this and you're explaining kind of that relationship with your fiancé, what are you feeling? ; Patient: I'm feeling angry and disappointed. ; Patient: Like I don't really know if I want to further anything because will it be like this forever? ; Patient: So I'm kind of just like angry and frustrated. ; Therapist: Is this similar to the anger that you've been experiencing recently, like at the dry cleaner and other places? ; Patient: It's far worse than that, but it's like... ; Patient: I think that's why I'm always so upset and angry. ; Therapist: So you're thinking that maybe that relationship or some part of that relationship is what's really causing the anger? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Because I feel alone at the same time completely. ; Patient: Like I'm not in a fair relationship. ; Patient: It's like I'm in a controlling one and I don't have freedom to do anything. ; Patient: I don't have help and it's just... it's weighing a lot of stress on me. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So is this... as you talk about this, do you feel like this is new information that you're kind of realizing something that you didn't realize before? ; Patient: Yeah, because honestly I kind of... I never really focused on that aspect of it. ; Patient: I kind of just thought that's the way it should go and I just thought I was angry because I just had bad days. ; Patient: I never really looked deep into it because I try so hard to make everything in my family right. ; Patient: So I kind of really don't pay attention. ; Patient: I kind of ignore it. ; Patient: But now that I'm thinking and putting out different things, it's going to spin into how I really feel. ; Therapist: So you feel this is kind of a big moment in terms of awareness? ; Patient: Definitely because I don't think I would have... like I said, I think I'm kind of... ; Patient: I try to hide it and really don't focus much on it because I want things to be perfect. ; Patient: So I think I kind of ignore it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So maybe through this session you've developed more insight about what's contributing to the anger. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely because I would just go off for no reason at all and just later just think about like, why did I even do that? ; Therapist: But this source of anger, this relationship, you recognize this as maybe more causal or more contributing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Whereas the other objects of your anger you weren't really sure. ; Patient: I wasn't sure at all why, but with that I definitely could see the reasons why I'm angry in my relationship. ; Therapist: Alright Jasmine, I feel like we've made some progress here and I'd like you to, between now and the next session, if you're comfortable with it, kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to the surface, what information has maybe been revealed to you a little bit and we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue. ; Therapist: Does that sound like a good plan? ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Patient: Definitely is a good plan. ; Therapist: Well I appreciate you coming in today and I'll see you in a week. ; Therapist: Okay, thank you.",

; Patient: More severe. ; Therapist: More severe. ; Therapist: So your cat passed away six months ago? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And these symptoms you've had for the last two months? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you're not sure if they're really related?

; Patient: Uh-huh. ; Therapist: Do you ever feel restless or kind of the opposite of that, like slowed down, like you can't move as fast as you want to? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I have noticed that like as, you know, the last couple months, like at work, it will be hard for me. ; Patient: It just feels like time is going so slowly and I just like, I want it, like almost like I'm in a dream and like I can't move. ; Patient: It's weird. ; Therapist: So you feel slowed down? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any feelings of worthlessness? ; Patient: I mean, yeah. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about that? ; Patient: Um, you know, I just don't think that anyone really cares about what happens to me. ; Therapist: How about your ability to concentrate? ; Therapist: Any changes there over the last two months? ; Patient: Yeah, like it's harder for me to like pay attention to movies and stuff and at work it's, I don't know if it's because I'm tired or what, but it's hard for me to pay attention to the projects I'm supposed to be working on and I have noticed, yes. ; Therapist: Do you have any thoughts related to death or dying? ; Patient: Not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Any drug or alcohol use? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Medical conditions? ; Patient: None. ; Therapist: Do you ever see or hear things other people can't see or hear? ; Patient: Not recently, no. ; Therapist: Not recently? ; Therapist: How about before that? ; Patient: Well, years ago I was hospitalized, but it was because my neighbors said that I was like throwing things and saying things that I didn't say like about the government, but I haven't had anything like that happen for years. ; Therapist: So this is years ago you were hospitalized. ; Therapist: Did they tell you anything about that hospitalization? ; Therapist: Like exactly why? ; Patient: I don't remember. ; Therapist: You don't remember it? ; Therapist: Did you feel depressed back then like you do now? ; Patient: Uh, I think maybe. ; Patient: I think probably some of the same things. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: It sounds like it's not clear in your memory what happened. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a period of time where you're too happy, where you had like a lot of energy and just couldn't stop moving? ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Alright, Sherry. ; Therapist: I'm going to get you in to see a counselor. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: It'll just take you a couple days for us to get you in to see somebody and it's my hope that they can help you. ; Therapist: I want to thank you for answering these questions. ; Therapist: This has been helpful. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Okay, so I noticed on your diary card that you have, that you did cut. ; Patient: Yep. ; Therapist: Okay, so let's talk about that a little bit. ; Therapist: What day did that happen on? ; Patient: Tuesday. ; Therapist: Tuesday? ; Therapist: Okay, so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut? ; Patient: Where I usually always am at school. ; Patient: I was at my locker. ; Patient: And that stupid girl. ; Therapist: What was going on at your locker? ; Patient: Melanie was talking about Tim. ; Patient: My Tim. ; Patient: My boyfriend. ; Patient: And I know it was my Tim she was talking about. ; Patient: I just wanted to punch her so bad. ; Therapist: Okay, so you were standing at your locker and you heard somebody say something about Tim that you didn't want to hear. ; Patient: Yeah, she was talking about him and he didn't text me the night before. ; Patient: So who knows what's going on. ; Therapist: What were you feeling right then? ; Patient: So angry. ; Patient: So angry. ; Therapist: On a scale of one to ten, how angry would you say you were? ; Patient: Like a nine. ; Therapist: Pretty angry then. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What did you do right then? ; Therapist: You were at your locker. ; Therapist: What's the next thing you did after you heard it? ; Patient: Next thing I did, I slammed my locker. ; Patient: Then I walked down to the gym. ; Patient: But what I wanted to do was push her or punch her. ; Therapist: So I know that the gym is usually the place where you cut. ; Therapist: Because you said you can go behind the bleachers. ; Therapist: People don't usually see you there. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, so where between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym, where did you decide to cut? ; Therapist: Because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody. ; Therapist: There must have been a point where you decided, I'm going to cut. ; Patient: I think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought, I can't punch her. ; Patient: I'm going to get in trouble. ; Patient: I'm going to go cut. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So that was when you decided to cut. ; Therapist: You went down to the gym. ; Therapist: What happened when you got there? ; Patient: Well, nobody was there because gym class isn't in the morning. ; Patient: So I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym. ; Patient: So I went behind the bleachers. ; Therapist: What did you use to cut? ; Patient: The pencil that I have always used. ; Therapist: It's the same pencil as usual? ; Therapist: The one with the metal tip? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of. ; Patient: Yeah, I know. ; Patient: It's just, it's my favorite pencil. ; Patient: I use it for school. ; Patient: And it's my favorite pencil. ; Therapist: Okay, so you still had the pencil. ; Therapist: You got under the bleachers. ; Therapist: You said you were feeling angry still. ; Therapist: Were you still on the scale of one to ten? ; Therapist: Where were you, when you got under the bleachers? ; Patient: I was still at like, I was still pretty high, maybe like an eight and a half though because I knew I was going to cut. ; Patient: So it like came down a little bit. ; Therapist: What were you thinking at that point? ; Patient: Well, I thought a couple things. ; Patient: I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil. ; Patient: And that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly. ; Therapist: So you have your pencil. ; Therapist: Where did you cut? ; Patient: On my leg. ; Therapist: How many times? ; Patient: Three. ; Therapist: How deep did you cut? ; Therapist: Was it deep enough that you needed a band-aid? ; Therapist: Did you need more than a band-aid? ; Patient: No, I mean, I guess I could have used a band-aid, but I mean, whatever. ; Therapist: But it wasn't so deep that you needed something more? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Right after you cut, where were you on the scale of one to ten with your anger? ; Patient: Like a three. ; Therapist: Three? ; Therapist: What were you thinking right afterwards? ; Patient: That felt good. ; Patient: I feel better. ; Patient: And I'm going to have to talk to Michelle about this. ; Therapist: Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day? ; Patient: The feeling better? ; Patient: Um, yeah, for the most part. ; Patient: Yeah, it did. ; Therapist: Okay, so that's what happened right afterwards. ; Therapist: Later in the day, what were you thinking about the cutting? ; Patient: Well, I kind of forgot about it. ; Patient: But then I just started thinking about it again right before bed. ; Patient: And just feeling really guilty that I cut. ; Patient: Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. ; Patient: And I just, I mean, in the night time I just constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like. ; Patient: I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time. ; Therapist: I know night is a really difficult time for you. ; Patient: It is, yeah. ; Therapist: Everything seems worse at night. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you were thinking back on it then and you were feeling guilty. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: That always seems to happen. ; Therapist: Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while, but it doesn't last. ; Patient: Yeah, I guess so. ; Therapist: I know you've also been working on doing less cutting. ; Patient: I've been doing pretty good. ; Therapist: You have. ; Therapist: You've been working really hard. ; Therapist: I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last, that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings. ; Patient: Yeah, maybe. ; Patient: I mean, those guilty feelings really suck. ; Therapist: Okay, so with the cutting, it sounds like the point where you decided to cut at your locker. ; Therapist: What triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Because she's stupid. ; Therapist: Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day. ; Therapist: You said you hadn't called, you hadn't been texting as much, and that was on your mind. ; Patient: Yeah, that's right. ; Therapist: So I'm wondering if at that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit. ; Patient: It's not going to bring it down all the way to a three though. ; Patient: I'll tell you that much. ; Therapist: It might not, but it'll bring it down a little bit. ; Therapist: Maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: Maybe there'll be things you'll feel good about later. ; Therapist: You won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: So the first thing is that pencil. ; Therapist: It sounds like it's comforting to have it. ; Patient: Yeah, it is. ; Therapist: But it also sounds like it's tempting. ; Therapist: What do you think about that? ; Patient: I mean, only if I am in the mood to cut, it's tempting. ; Therapist: Sounds like having that pencil is gonna make it harder to try other things. ; Therapist: And you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting anymore or cutting less. ; Patient: Yeah, I am. ; Therapist: Sounds like that pencil is standing in your way. ; Patient: Yeah, maybe. ; Therapist: What do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time? ; Therapist: Choosing a different favorite pencil that maybe you can't cut with. ; Patient: I mean, maybe, only if it can be like a really cool pencil. ; Therapist: That way you can still have something that can be your favorite, but which won't tempt you. ; Therapist: That'll make it easier to try the two things. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, what do you think our first thing should be? ; Therapist: What do you think you can try? ; Therapist: You just heard somebody say something you don't wanna hear, you're feeling pretty angry. ; Therapist: What can you do in that moment? ; Patient: Well, what I do a lot at home when my mom's bothering me and saying stuff I don't wanna hear, I put my headphones on. ; Therapist: Do you have your headphones with you at school? ; Patient: Yeah, they actually, they let me keep them on in school. ; Therapist: Is that something you'd be willing to try next time? ; Patient: I think so, there's a few songs that usually help me, so I think so. ; Therapist: Okay, that sounds like a good one to try. ; Therapist: So we have headphones, we need to come up with one more. ; Therapist: What do you think you'd like to try? ; Patient: Well, I really like my teacher, Mrs. Eaton, so she seems to always kinda be there when I need to talk, and her room's kinda right down the hallway from my locker, in the same hallway, so I guess I could talk to her. ; Therapist: That sounds like a good option. ; Therapist: So that's our goal, is to keep pushing cutting further down the list, and to keep adding things that you're gonna try first, and you're right, that the first thing you try might not bring you all the way down to a two or a three, but it might bring you down a little bit, and each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more, so you have to be willing to try a few things. ; Therapist: Can you do that? ; Patient: I can, but I really want a cooler pencil, though, like a cooler pencil, so I don't know, maybe we could go look for a pencil together? ; Therapist: I think that's a good idea. ; Patient: Okay, I'd like that. ; Therapist: Okay, thank you for answering all of my questions on this. ; Therapist: You did a great job with this chain, and I know it wasn't easy. ; Patient: Yeah, you're welcome. ; Therapist: Let's go look for that pencil.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hello, Alison. ; Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm good. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well. ; Therapist: Thanks for asking. ; Therapist: I was hoping we could start today by beginning your treatment plan. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I don't know if you remember from the first session that I had told you about, but I was hoping we could start today by beginning your treatment plan. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I don't know if you remember from the first session that I had told you around session four that we would start your treatment plan and try to finish it around session five. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So the treatment plan, I usually like the treatment plan to have two or three goals and each goal has some objectives. ; Therapist: So today I thought we'd just work on one goal. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And I'll kind of get that down and then give you some time to think about it until next week and then kind of work on the other goals from there. ; Therapist: We'll finish off the treatment plan next week. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: That sounds good. ; Therapist: That sound okay to you? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So the goal is kind of like your overarching goal for therapy in general. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Which I'm going to note too are specific tasks you can do that will help you achieve that goal. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So they're specific, they're measurable, and we hope they're achievable. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So you have like an overall goal in mind for our counseling sessions? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: I would like to be able to kind of, I've been feeling a little depressed and I would really like to be able to reduce those, you know, the depression. ; Therapist: So reduce feelings of depression? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: That would be your goal. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Sounds like a good goal. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So what objectives, what tasks do you think that you could do that would help you to feel less depressed? ; Patient: I guess maybe some sort of physical activity, maybe like walking. ; Patient: I like to be outside, so maybe walking could be one. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Have you had a plan before where you've walked regularly? ; Patient: You know, I used to. ; Patient: I did. ; Patient: And it would give me some relief because I was able to clear my mind whenever I was walking. ; Patient: So yes, yes. ; Patient: I've had success with walking before. ; Therapist: So walking has worked before? ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: And you've noticed that you're walking less since you've had a feelings of depression? ; Patient: I have been. ; Patient: I really haven't been doing too much of anything. ; Patient: I've just been kind of at home doing homework, stressing out over getting homework done because I'm back in school and it's been so stressful and overwhelming. ; Patient: Like I said, it's just kind of got me in this little funk, this depressed mood. ; Therapist: Well, since you're on the topic of homework, is there something you think you can do there? ; Therapist: You mentioned that it's stressful and overwhelming and that sounds like the type of feelings that are related to depression sometimes. ; Therapist: Do you find that kind of being stressed about the homework is? ; Patient: Yeah, because you know, it's so much work to be done and sometimes I get several assignments due and at the same time I find myself rushing to get assignments in and you know, it can just be a little daunting. ; Patient: It's just overwhelming sometimes. ; Patient: So yeah, and I don't know, maybe if I spaced it out and you know, took, you know, did some time management or something like that, I don't know, to kind of help me with that. ; Therapist: So you feel like maybe you're starting the homework late compared to when it's due? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: So that's where the feeling, maybe overwhelmed? ; Patient: Yes, I would say that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So yeah, you're right, it sounds like this is just an organizational thing, right? ; Therapist: So if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier and do it in small bits instead of waiting more or less the last minute, that would reduce, I mean likely I would think, reduce some of the stress and feelings of being overwhelmed. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm sure it would. ; Therapist: You sure would. ; Therapist: So you want to make that your second objective then? ; Therapist: So you have the walking. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And then you'll have trying to space out the homework. ; Patient: Yeah, okay. ; Patient: That sounds doable. ; Therapist: That sound good? ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So we have, so we have the walking and then spacing out the homework a little more. ; Therapist: So that's two objectives and both of those seem tied to the feelings, to the oppressive feelings that you're trying to eliminate. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: What other objectives might work? ; Patient: Let's see. ; Patient: You know, since I've been back in school, I just kind of, you know, I used to love to sing and I haven't done that in a while. ; Patient: And so maybe getting out and singing again and, you know, socializing with my friends that I used to sing with, maybe that could help because it would get me out of the house, you know. ; Therapist: Has that worked in the past for you? ; Patient: You know, it was something that I enjoyed doing. ; Patient: And right now I feel like I'm not doing any of the things that I've enjoyed doing because I've been so busy doing work, doing homework. ; Patient: So I think that would probably help. ; Therapist: So it's a good break from thinking about, stressing about, as you put it, the homework. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: For you. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: It has kind of a, I mean the singing part's fun for you it sounds like, but also there's a social component it seems like. ; Patient: Yes, it is. ; Patient: It is. ; Patient: So I enjoy, like I said, I enjoy singing and, you know, I enjoy the people that I would sing with and we would go and hang out together, go to different, you know, like jazz clubs or events, you know, different bands that we're playing at, you know, it would just be nice. ; Patient: It's fun. ; Patient: So I love music. ; Patient: So I love listening to it and I love, you know, singing. ; Patient: So making music. ; Patient: So that would be, I think that would be a good goal. ; Therapist: You seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing. ; Patient: Yes, I just love it. ; Patient: I enjoy doing it and I just haven't had a chance to do it lately. ; Therapist: So part of this is just making the time. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So we'll make that a third objective. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And singing and that socializing that accompanies that singing. ; Therapist: That's great. ; Therapist: So, three objectives is good. ; Therapist: I try to get to four if you have one. ; Therapist: Is there a fourth objective that you can think of, something else that you associated with not feeling depressed? ; Patient: Well, I used to absolutely love going to the beach and visiting with my aunt. ; Patient: And so that's two things. ; Patient: The beach. ; Patient: I love the beach because it's soothing. ; Patient: It's comforting. ; Patient: And my aunt, she's just such an awesome person. ; Patient: She's always pouring into me and I just love spending time with her. ; Therapist: And she lives down at the beach. ; Patient: Yes, she does. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So that's, it seems like a good objective too. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So, you're suggesting maybe visiting her more often? ; Patient: Yes, again, just at home doing homework and I haven't gone to visit her. ; Patient: And the thing is she only lives like an hour away. ; Therapist: So it's not a huge ride. ; Patient: No, it's not. ; Patient: So that's like a little trip I can do on a Saturday. ; Patient: So I can take a break and go down there and spend some time with her. ; Patient: I think that would be helpful. ; Therapist: So again, kind of getting away from the school stressors and kind of just taking a break from it for a day. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And then also spending time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So I want to go through each one of these. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And make sure that we're kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: These are all specific, which is good. ; Therapist: Do you feel these are all achievable? ; Therapist: These are things you can do? ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: Yes, I do. ; Therapist: Well, some of them you've done in the past, right? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So now we have the specific and the achievable. ; Therapist: Now I want to get to parts a little more tricky, which is making it measurable. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: What I'd like to do here, and I don't want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives. ; Therapist: I want you to decide. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But I want to see if we can quantify in some manner how often you'll be able to do these different things, or how, you know, like in the homework, we'll have to think about the spacing would be the quantity. ; Therapist: But first with the walking. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So in a given week, say, what's realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking? ; Therapist: How many times? ; Patient: Maybe I can start out with twice a week. ; Therapist: Twice a week. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you have two particular days in mind? ; Therapist: Days where your responsibilities aren't too great and you have that opportunity? ; Patient: Maybe we need to start with one day a week. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Let's go with one day a week. ; Therapist: Let's go one time. ; Therapist: One time a week. ; Patient: Let's start with one and then we'll see what happens. ; Therapist: That's a good start. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So what day of the week are you thinking of for walking? ; Therapist: How about Monday? ; Therapist: Is there a window of opportunity there you see on Monday? ; Patient: It is. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Plus, it just kind of, I think, well, no, no. ; Therapist: How about Wednesday? ; Patient: Wednesday. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Wednesday, middle of the week, stress from work and school and, yes, Wednesday sounds good. ; Therapist: Wednesday. ; Therapist: Do you have a particular time range you like to walk, what would be the time of the day? ; Patient: Like 6.30. ; Therapist: That's a good time for you? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: That's a time you can get out of the house? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Off work and give me a little bit of time to get home and change and out the door because if I make it too late, I'm not going to go. ; Patient: So 6.30 is kind of a good, that's the good time to get out there. ; Therapist: Yes, 6.30. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: So we'll start with that objective, the walking. ; Therapist: Every Wednesday at 6.30. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And for every amount of time you're comfortable with. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So the homework. ; Therapist: This is a little trickier. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: So this is about spacing it out. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So the homework assignments, they're stressing it out. ; Therapist: How much time do they take? ; Therapist: Well, I'll ask you a few questions. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: How much time do they take to complete generally? ; Therapist: Like in hours, so. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: It depends on the assignment. ; Therapist: Have you had the average? ; Patient: The average, maybe about two hours, two and a half hours, I guess. ; Therapist: Well, let's go with the worst case. ; Therapist: Let's go two and a half hours just to cover the worst case. ; Therapist: Would that generally be the worst case? ; Patient: I think so, maybe. ; Patient: It depends because of, yeah. ; Therapist: Want me to get three? ; Patient: Yeah, let's make it three. ; Therapist: And then how much time do you have from when it's assigned to when it's due, usually? ; Patient: Maybe a couple of weeks. ; Therapist: A couple of weeks? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And what have you been doing now in terms of managing those three hours relative to that two-week period? ; Therapist: Like it doesn't sound like you're doing it early in the two-week period. ; Patient: No, I'm not. ; Therapist: Yeah, so a little bit later? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I get distracted, so I get a little distracted. ; Patient: So it's, you know, I start reading and I'll fall asleep or I get distracted by something or, and then before you know it, the time is gone and I'm rushing at the end to try and get it all done. ; Patient: Two hours with the work. ; Patient: Three hours. ; Therapist: Three hours with the work. ; Therapist: Squeezed into the last, okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I could see how that would be stressful. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What day of the week is it usually assigned? ; Patient: On Tuesdays. ; Therapist: On Tuesdays. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you have Tuesday and then you have another Tuesday and then the week after that is due. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You have three hours of work in those two weeks. ; Therapist: So let's look at it this way maybe. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: What time could you set aside, say near that first Tuesday, that you could put maybe the first hour in? ; Therapist: Maybe divide it in three parts? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Is that enough parts? ; Patient: Yeah, it should be. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Can you say what time? ; Therapist: Yeah, what would be the first day and time? ; Therapist: Like kind of like when you specify Wednesday at 6-30, that's going to be your walk-in time. ; Therapist: Right, right. ; Therapist: How about the time when you could start the homework? ; Therapist: If it's the first hour. ; Patient: Maybe after I've come back from my walk on Wednesdays. ; Therapist: How long do you foresee a walk? ; Patient: Normally I only walk for an hour. ; Therapist: So give you some time to decompress maybe around 8, 8 o'clock. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So from 8 to 9 on Tuesday, on Wednesday, I'm sorry. ; Patient: Wednesday. ; Therapist: On Wednesday, you'll get that first third of your homework. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then you'll stop. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: That'll be that for the night. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Does that sound like a plan? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: What's the second hour? ; Therapist: Maybe a few days, give yourself a few days. ; Patient: No, I guess I could start it Thursday. ; Therapist: Thursday? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So that's just one day apart. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You want to make yourself more time? ; Therapist: It seems like you're not sure. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Let's do Thursday. ; Therapist: You want to go Thursday? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: In an hour? ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: And what hour do you have in mind? ; Patient: Thursdays, about 7 o'clock. ; Therapist: So about 7 to 8? ; Patient: 7 to 8. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So one night, Wednesday, it'll be 8 to 9, it's your walk. ; Therapist: And then on Thursday, 7 to 9. ; Patient: Well, that's two hours. ; Therapist: 7 to 8, sorry. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So now just the last hour remains. ; Therapist: Sunday. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Sunday. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So you want to get everything done from Tuesday to Sunday night. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And have the rest of that time off. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Are you sure that's achievable? ; Therapist: That seems like you're getting a lot in there. ; Therapist: Do you think you can do it? ; Patient: I'll get dry. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: That sounds good. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: What time Sunday? ; Patient: Sunday around 5. ; Therapist: So 5 to 6? ; Patient: 5 to 6, yes. ; Therapist: And I'm assuming it won't run over because we kind of asked me on the high side, but if it did, would you be able to go 5 to 7? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So that's kind of like flexible time there. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So what would that feel like to get your homework done by Sunday? ; Patient: It would be a relief. ; Patient: And then I could do some other stuff like, you know, maybe my next goal. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, and there's a potential backup plan I see in here is that if something happens on Sunday, where you need more time and you don't want to stress, you still have that Wednesday after you walk, bacon. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So that could be like your backup. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Because you still have another six days to have done after that. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Does that seem realistic and achievable? ; Patient: It does. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So how about the singing? ; Patient: I have no idea how long the singing thing takes, so. ; Patient: Well, if I get back in the group that I was in, we would normally get together on a Friday after work. ; Therapist: Every Friday, every so many Fridays? ; Patient: Every Friday. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: So on Fridays, it would just be rehearsal. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And then another Friday, it would be a shorter rehearsal, and then we would go someplace if we knew of a group of some friends of ours that were performing. ; Therapist: So this is an every Friday commitment, right, the singing? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: But one Friday is generally, it's like the end, about two hours. ; Therapist: About two hours. ; Therapist: So two hours every Friday. ; Therapist: This is something you really enjoy, though. ; Patient: It is. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you look forward to it. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So Friday, two hours, I guess, would be the afternoon or evening? ; Patient: Evening. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So that's one that you would kind of look forward to. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: The singing. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So that's one you feel you could achieve a couple hours on Friday. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: So I think it was something that came up that I really had to get done. ; Patient: It's not like I can't not go. ; Therapist: So... ; Therapist: It won't be managed or anything? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: They know I'm in school. ; Patient: In school, they understand. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: So then there's the last objective. ; Therapist: This is, I guess, about a whole day commitment, right, because you go to the beach. ; Patient: That would be more like a Saturday. ; Therapist: But of course it wouldn't be every Saturday. ; Therapist: So how many times in, say, a month? ; Therapist: Like once? ; Patient: Once a month. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you would go down on Saturday morning and come back that same day? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Is that something you look forward to? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Is that something that would be okay in terms of like, because on Friday night potentially you'd be out, right? ; Therapist: And then Saturday. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: But if I, if on those Saturdays that I know that I'm going, I could not be out too late on that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's a good idea. ; Therapist: So you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: When you know that Saturday's coming. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Or not go at all that Friday. ; Therapist: Either way. ; Therapist: Just take a break that time. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Re-store. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: So that's four separate objectives. ; Therapist: And what I want to do since I've kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want to take a moment, just take a break and print this up for you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: We'll work on the rest of your goals next time, but I want you to have this so you can get started on it right away. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So before I print these up, is there any changes you want to make? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I would like to try that and if it doesn't work, can we tweak it? ; Therapist: Oh yeah. ; Therapist: Just make changes. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Maybe certain things will work really well. ; Therapist: Maybe certain things will have to take off the list altogether and maybe substitute something else. ; Therapist: But yeah, we can make edits to it the whole time you're here. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: We can just make a document that changes as needed. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But if you think it's a good starting place, I'll go ahead and print this up as it is and give you a copy and we can resume with today's session and then next time I see you in a week, we'll work on the rest of the treatment plan. ; Patient: Sounds good. ; Therapist: Does that sound like a good plan? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Thanks Alison. ; Patient: Thank you.",

I think you touched on this before, but how do you do with quiet activities, like for example, reading? ; Patient: Oh, I really struggle with that. ; Therapist: You struggle with that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I can play a video game for an hour, but I can't read or play a game or draw. ; Therapist: So when you are engaged in quiet activities, do you find yourself kind of wandering off? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: You do? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you ever feel like you have an internal motor that won't shut off? ; Patient: No, I wouldn't say that. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you feel like you talk excessively? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Yeah, almost to the point that I ... Well, not even almost. ; Patient: I interrupt people a lot. ; Therapist: What settings do you find that's a problem? ; Patient: At school is a big one. ; Therapist: That's a big one? ; Patient: Yeah, because I'll talk and I'll talk. ; Patient: I mean, I'll get off track when called on by the teacher, and then somebody else will say something and it'll be like, oh yeah, no, I forgot. ; Patient: Yeah, that too. ; Patient: I mean, I feel horrible, but I just, I can't stop it. ; Therapist: Do you ever find that, say in class, you blurt things out? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Therapist: And interrupt people? ; Patient: Yes, I do interrupt people. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Have a situation where, like say at work or school or at home, where you have to wait your turn for something. ; Therapist: Do you find that's a problem? ; Patient: What, like at a drive-thru? ; Therapist: It could be a drive-thru. ; Therapist: Do you ... If you're a drive-thru, do you find ... ; Patient: I mean, doesn't really ... I don't get it. ; Therapist: You don't have any trouble with waiting in lines or waiting for your turn? ; Patient: I guess not. ; Therapist: I guess not. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, I'm going to get you in to see one of our counselors. ; Therapist: You mentioned that these symptoms are bothersome to you. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And I want to make sure you get treated. ; Therapist: It'll take a couple days to get you in to see somebody. ; Therapist: Is that okay? ; Patient: Yes, that's fine. ; Therapist: Well, Lisa, I want to thank you for spending this time with me and answering these questions. ; Therapist: This has been really helpful. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Barbara Roberts. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: Hello there. ; Patient: My name is Dr. Betty. ; Patient: I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. ; Patient: First of all, what would you like me to call you? ; Patient: Well, you can call me Barbara. ; Patient: That'll be fine. ; Patient: Okay, that's fine. ; Patient: Okay, so Barbara, I'm seeing you today. ; Patient: But I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? ; Patient: Yes, Dr. Brown's my doctor. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: What is it that's brought you to see me today? ; Patient: Well, I've come about my tummy problem. ; Patient: I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. ; Patient: I thought perhaps I'd come and see you to see if you could help. ; Patient: Right, okay. ; Patient: Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? ; Patient: Well, I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. ; Patient: It very often feels bloated. ; Patient: I swing between being constipated and having diarrhoea. ; Patient: I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes and other times it stabs. ; Patient: It's a real stabbing feeling. ; Patient: I often have the urge to go to the toilet and I pass very smelly wind. ; Patient: So quite a few symptoms there and some of them sound quite troublesome to you. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: And how long has this been going on? ; Patient: Well, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. ; Patient: I had a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhoea and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. ; Patient: Okay, okay. ; Patient: So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: And what sort of treatments have you tried for this before? ; Patient: Well, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. ; Patient: But I've been to the health shop and they've been really helpful. ; Patient: They've given me lots of different tablets and medicines for different things. ; Patient: Oh, and Imodium. ; Patient: I have Imodium in my handbag all the time just in case. ; Patient: So these different tablets that you've got from the herbal shop, how are you taking them? ; Patient: Well, different tablets. ; Patient: You know, I don't have the same problem every day so I'll take some tablets for certain symptoms and other tablets for other things. ; Patient: So am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis what you're going to take depending on what your stomach's doing? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Okay, okay. ; Patient: And what about tests? ; Patient: Have you had any tests for these problems? ; Patient: Yes, I had in the early days I had a gastroscopy. ; Patient: Was that the tube down from the top? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: And at the same time I had a barium enema. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: That was very uncomfortable. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: But no, I've tried, well, I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that that they didn't find anything and he's just not sent me for any more. ; Patient: That's it now as far as he's concerned. ; Patient: Sent me back to the doctor. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: It sounds as though you're not happy with that. ; Patient: Well, you know, I think that actually the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? ; Patient: And he's decided that I've had enough tests and, you know, if you go on the internet there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: If I had a bit more money I'd go private. ; Patient: I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: So you feel as though actually enough hasn't been done in the way of tests? ; Patient: No, he's not. ; Patient: There's loads more he could do, I'm sure. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: It sounds like you've had these problems now for about four years. ; Patient: You've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. ; Patient: You've tried a lot of tablets, some prescribed, some herbal remedies and you've had some investigations but you're not entirely happy that you've even been investigated thoroughly enough. ; Patient: Is that about... I'd say so, yes. ; Therapist: Have I got the story right? ; Therapist: Yes. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: And can I ask you, Barbara, how is all of this affecting you day to day? ; Patient: How's it affecting your life? ; Patient: Well, it's had quite a big impact. ; Patient: I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing I suppose is that I went from being full-time to part-time at work. ; Patient: I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: And so I went part-time. ; Patient: But in the end, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I miss that. ; Patient: I miss the girls. ; Patient: We used to go out at least once a week to the pictures or for a drink. ; Patient: That's one thing. ; Patient: Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: We used to have a laugh. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I used to go to swing into shape. ; Patient: I used to go to an exercise class. ; Patient: That was... I missed the exercise actually. ; Patient: That was once a week. ; Patient: But the thing was I wasn't comfortable... ; Patient: I never felt quite right doing all this exercise. ; Patient: I was always worried I was going to be taken short or... So I stopped that. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Then... Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. ; Patient: That's another thing we don't do anymore now. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Yes, quite a few things really. ; Patient: Yes, it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed quite a lot because of these symptoms. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: It sounds like you're doing... there are a few of the things that you used to do. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: What is it you spend your average day doing now? ; Patient: Well, I potter around the house. ; Patient: I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching... I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. ; Patient: They draw you in, don't they? ; Patient: They certainly do. ; Patient: I read a bit. ; Patient: There are magazines. ; Patient: But generally I'm at home. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? ; Patient: For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? ; Patient: Well, last year my son got married and I have to say I was worried that I wouldn't be able to cope with it, that I wouldn't be feeling well enough. ; Patient: Surprisingly enough, I was in good form. ; Patient: I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. ; Patient: But I was in really good form for that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: That was a good time. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: And how were your tummy symptoms then? ; Patient: I hardly noticed them. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: It seemed to clear up. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Which was good. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: That's interesting. ; Patient: And are there any times when your tummy symptoms bother you more, seem particularly bad? ; Patient: Well, I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. ; Patient: It's particularly uncomfortable. ; Patient: I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. ; Patient: He travels with his job and he can be away a couple of times a month. ; Patient: And that's not, it's not a bad thing but it's very often not good then, I have to say. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: So you notice it's, they're worse when your husband's not around. ; Patient: Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more. ; Patient: I don't know when he's not there. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. ; Patient: What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? ; Patient: Well, he's, he thinks it's all in my head. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: He's, yeah, he says it's stress. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: And what do you think? ; Patient: Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. ; Patient: I get too much physical pain for it to be in my head. ; Patient: I mean, it's real. ; Patient: It's, it's a real pain. ; Therapist: And have you ; Patient: had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? ; Patient: Well, I mean, I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up in the early stages. ; Patient: But I think, I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. ; Patient: A friend of mine's got that and it sounds similar. ; Patient: And then other times I'll think, I wonder if it's an ulcer. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: On a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: My mother-in-law, my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a growth that the doctor didn't investigate. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: By the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football. ; Patient: And of course it was too late to operate then. ; Patient: So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, I just feel and make sure there's nothing different going on. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: And yeah, I worry about that. ; Patient: So you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night. ; Therapist: Oh yes. ; Patient: To see if you can feel anything. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: So just to make sure that I've got the story straight, you've, you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. ; Patient: You've tried a variety of medications, some prescribed, some from the herbal shop and none of them really made a great deal of difference. ; Patient: You've had some investigations, but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. ; Patient: And at times you worry that this could be something quite serious like a cancer. ; Patient: Is that, have I got the story right? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? ; Patient: Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here and you've just finished your medical training. ; Patient: I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at, at the problem. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: You probably know about different tests, new tests that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests. ; Patient: Hmm. ; Patient: Well, I think there's, there's got to be something that a test might, might reveal. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Well, I think Barbara, having, having heard your story and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. ; Patient: And the reason for that is because you've, you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years and they've not shown anything. ; Patient: And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. ; Patient: So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that, that they'd show anything different than what we already know. ; Patient: So it would be, I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. ; Patient: So it's like, do you think it's all in my head then? ; Patient: You're going to be like Dr. ; Patient: Brown. ; Patient: You think I'm imagining all of this? ; Patient: No, I think that you clearly have pain and it clearly, you have lots of physical symptoms and they clearly getting in the way of your life and causing you a lot of disability. ; Patient: I guess, I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. ; Patient: Sometimes these things can go together. ; Patient: I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and that when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, somehow your symptoms then will seem greater. ; Patient: So I guess what I'm wondering Barbara is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind and what's going on in your life and how much your symptoms trouble you. ; Patient: Do you think that's a possibility? ; Patient: Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. ; Patient: I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. ; Patient: I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms. ; Patient: Given that we've tried medication for you and we've tried investigations and we've drawn a blank really with those, none of those have really helped you. ; Patient: I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. ; Patient: I think that's a good approach to your problems. ; Patient: What sort of approach? ; Patient: Well, I guess thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years your life's really changed. ; Patient: It seems to have really shrunk down and it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of. ; Patient: Is that right? ; Patient: Well, I just can't do them. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I can't do them anymore. ; Patient: And I guess I wonder, it sounds as though you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if in a funny way what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now has kind of fed into your feeling unhappy with the way that your life is at the moment. ; Patient: And I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. ; Patient: Oh, I don't know. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: And I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life. ; Patient: I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking and the fact that you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth us sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. ; Patient: What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for, say, two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference? ; Patient: Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. ; Patient: I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law. ; Patient: You know, they left her and didn't spot it. ; Patient: Well, I guess if we did decide to work together like this, this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. ; Patient: We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. ; Patient: But if they stay the same, then we could be pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that we're missing. ; Patient: How would that sound? ; Patient: So, what are you saying then, that I should come back and see you? ; Patient: I think that would be a good idea. ; Patient: I think we've only just begun to talk about it, and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back, perhaps if you booked him for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. ; Patient: And perhaps if you could also bring your tablets in or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. ; Patient: How would that sound, Barbara? ; Patient: Okay, well, to make an appointment for next week, I'll come back and see you again and talk about it a bit more. ; Patient: Yes, I think so. ; Patient: I think that would be a good start. ; Patient: And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking. ; Patient: I won't bring all the bottles down. ; Patient: Okay, all right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: So, shall I see you again next week? ; Patient: I'll make an appointment for next week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: Thank you, Barbara. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Bye bye.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, this is Dr. Grande. ; Therapist: I hope you find this video useful. ; Therapist: If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel. ; Therapist: As always, thanks for watching. ; Therapist: Hello, Peggy. ; Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Therapist: Hi, Dr. Grande. ; Patient: I'm okay. ; Therapist: You're okay? ; Patient: I am. ; Therapist: Yesterday, when you were here at the agency, you took a few different tests. ; Therapist: Do you remember that? ; Patient: I did. ; Therapist: One of the tests that you took is called the SCL-90, the symptom checklist 90. ; Therapist: Do you remember taking that test? ; Patient: I think so. ; Therapist: It's 90 items and they're ranked. ; Patient: Ask me like true and false questions. ; Therapist: They're not true and false. ; Therapist: They're numbers that you select. ; Patient: Oh, okay. ; Patient: I do remember that. ; Therapist: Remember that? ; Therapist: So, I have the results from that test and I want to review some of those findings with you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Is that all right? ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: So, this particular instrument has a number of what we refer to as subscales. ; Therapist: So, these are areas that are measured by the instrument. ; Therapist: For example, depression or anxiety. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, I'm going to review a few of these subscales, ones where you scored a little higher than we might expect. ; Therapist: I'll just review those with you and see what you think and we can talk about it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Are you recording this? ; Therapist: I'm not. ; Therapist: Are you worried about that? ; Patient: Well, I think you probably are, but okay. ; Therapist: What makes you think I'm recording it? ; Patient: Because that happens to me a lot. ; Therapist: It happens to you a lot that you get recorded? ; Patient: I think so, yes. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you remember the last time that happened to you? ; Patient: Probably yesterday. ; Therapist: And do you think you were recorded while you were taking this? ; Patient: Probably, yes. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: That sounds worrisome. ; Therapist: That's a feeling you get a lot that you're being recorded? ; Patient: I worry about it a lot. ; Therapist: You worry about it a lot. ; Patient: But I know it's happening. ; Patient: That's why I worry about it. ; Therapist: You're certain that's happening? ; Patient: Yeah, I am. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, you're not being recorded now. ; Patient: I know it probably feels like you are, but you're not. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: But I appreciate you bringing up that concern with me. ; Therapist: So a few of the scales where you were a bit elevated on, I want to discuss, as I mentioned. ; Therapist: I need to explain the concept of percentile rank to you. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Is that a term you've ever heard, percentile rank? ; Patient: I think so in school. ; Therapist: Maybe in school, right. ; Therapist: That would make sense. ; Therapist: So say, for instance, you had a percentile rank of 65%, right, percentile. ; Therapist: That would mean that your score is equal to or higher than 65% of the people that took that test. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So if you took a test on math or English and you were at, say, 75 percentile, you'd be higher than three-quarters of the people that took the test, 75 percentile. ; Patient: I think I understand that. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: I think so. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If you want me to come back to that later, just let me know as I go through if it doesn't make sense. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So areas here on the SCL results where you were a bit higher than we would normally see, one is the phobic anxiety scale. ; Therapist: On that one, you were about 64 percentile. ; Therapist: So your score was as high or higher than 64% of people that would take it. ; Patient: To more than half the people in the population. ; Therapist: More than half the people in the same situation as you in outpatient mental health treatment. ; Patient: So I have more phobic anxiety than most people. ; Therapist: It does seem that way. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So this construct would measure things like being afraid of going out, being afraid of being in crowds. ; Therapist: Does that connect with you? ; Therapist: Does that seem like a fear that you have? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about that? ; Patient: I don't like being on public transportation. ; Patient: Crowds make me nervous. ; Patient: And if I ever have to public speak, I feel like I'm just going to pass out. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So it does appear that you have kind of phobic anxiety symptoms. ; Therapist: So that score, that 64 percentile, that kind of makes sense. ; Patient: I kind of get that. ; Patient: I get that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: I want to move on to the next one, which is paranoia. ; Therapist: So in this one, you were at the 84th percentile. ; Therapist: So quite a bit higher. ; Patient: Is that where you were recording me? ; Therapist: This wasn't recorded. ; Therapist: Nothing was recorded here. ; Therapist: I understand that's a worry that you have. ; Patient: Are you going to share those results with anybody? ; Therapist: In your particular case, the only people that would be shared with is the rest of the treatment team and anybody that you sign a release for. ; Patient: But if the government asked you, you'd have to give them those results? ; Therapist: There's no reason right now why I did that. ; Therapist: There are certain limits to confidentiality, but in your situation here at this clinic, there's no reason I would share this information with the government or anybody else other than the people I indicated. ; Therapist: So the rest of the people here would treat you. ; Therapist: And if you wanted to release the results to somebody, you could sign a release, and I would let them have the results. ; Therapist: Are you worried about the results getting to other people? ; Patient: Well, I'm worried that I know people are recording me, and I think that that result shows that I know that's happening. ; Patient: And now you want to make it look like that means I have a problem when I'm just reporting what I know is true. ; Therapist: All right, so you're worried that we're trying to prove that you're paranoid. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And kind of rigging the results of this test to make it ; Patient: But this test says that I'm wrong to think that it makes me paranoid. ; Therapist: Oh, I understand. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, these things are really happening. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: But the test is arranged so that it's making you look paranoid when you're not. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: Because it's not paranoia in your case. ; Therapist: It's really true. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So that would explain why your score is elevated on this scale. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Is that what you're thinking? ; Patient: I do, yes. ; Therapist: And I wanted you to know that. ; Therapist: Well, I appreciate you telling me that. ; Therapist: Do you think it's possible that it's working the other way around, that the test is measuring something that is actually there? ; Patient: No, I don't think so. ; Therapist: You don't think so? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, you understand that result, that the 84 percentile, you understand what that means? ; Therapist: Higher than we'd expect? ; Patient: I understand that I'm higher than 84—I'm higher than 84 percent of the population. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: But those people just think that's happening. ; Patient: And I know what is. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: You believe their situation is different than yours? ; Therapist: I do. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I understand. ; Therapist: So the last area, the last subscale I want to discuss—there's one global scale I want to discuss—the last subscale is one that's referred to as psychoticism. ; Therapist: And there you are at the 93rd percentile. ; Therapist: And that's when maybe you can—you hear things other people don't hear or see things other people don't see or have beliefs or thinking that are far outside the norm and can't be supported by evidence. ; Therapist: Do you ever feel like that's happening to you? ; Patient: Are you going to put me away? ; Therapist: There's nothing here that would indicate that I'm going to put you away or send you anywhere. ; Therapist: You know, I just really, the purpose of this is just to discuss the results, to make sure you understand kind of how these inform our treatment of you. ; Therapist: Like, so we're going to provide treatment to you in part based on these results. ; Patient: Sometimes I hear things other people don't hear. ; Patient: I know that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So this is a score that makes sense to you, where you think the test might be right. ; Patient: Maybe that's true. ; Therapist: Maybe that's true. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: But I am being recorded. ; Therapist: But you believe you're being recorded. ; Therapist: You're certain of that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you understand those three scores, right, the phobic anxiety, the paranoid scale, subscale, and the psychoticism subscale. ; Therapist: I'd like to talk about one referred to as the global severity index. ; Therapist: So this kind of takes all the different scores, all different items that you responded to, and gives us a big picture of how you're doing. ; Therapist: You know, how bad your symptoms are, how bothersome they are overall. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Uh-huh. ; Therapist: On this one, you were at the 68th percentile. ; Therapist: Close to normal. ; Therapist: Well, a little bit higher than we'd want to see. ; Therapist: Not extremely far out, but it's 18 percentile higher than we'd want. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Or than we'd normally see, rather. ; Therapist: So it's a bit of a concern. ; Therapist: Do you feel like overall you're dealing with symptoms okay? ; Patient: I mean, I don't like to go out much. ; Patient: And it really frustrates me when I see things or hear things other people don't. ; Patient: I promise you. ; Patient: But the other score is high, and it shouldn't be. ; Patient: So I might be closer to normal than you think. ; Therapist: So with the paranoid, if that scale was accurate, then your estimation, your global severity might be lower. ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Closer to that 50 percentile. ; Patient: I think so. ; Therapist: So even if you were closer to the 50 percentile, you can understand how we're concerned that your symptoms are somewhat severe. ; Therapist: And we want to make sure we deliver treatment to address that. ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: Is that okay? ; Patient: It is. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So I will meet with the counselor that will be treating you here. ; Therapist: And I'm going to go over these scores, and I'll explain to her what you've explained to me. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: In terms of why you think you might have received each score. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I'll go over that with her. ; Therapist: And of course, you could discuss that with her too. ; Therapist: And she'll have the results of this test in your chart. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: She's not going to record our session, is she? ; Therapist: She's not going to be recording. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense, everything I've talked about here today? ; Patient: It does. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I appreciate you allowing me to go over this set of results with you. ; Therapist: And I'll get you assigned to that counselor, and we'll move forward with treatment. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Carly, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm good. ; Patient: How about you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well, thanks for asking. ; Therapist: How did you do this week? ; Patient: Better. ; Therapist: Better? ; Patient: Well, last time we talked about the... ; Therapist: The postpone graphication? ; Patient: Yeah, that. ; Patient: And I think you wanted 10 minutes for me to put it off? ; Therapist: 10 minutes, yeah. ; Patient: So I did better. ; Patient: I think I ended up only doing like a joint and a half instead of two. ; Patient: I was able to put it off for I think the 10 minutes a couple times and then there was I think one or two days where I went out for a walk because I was tired of staring at the clock waiting for the 10 minutes to pass. ; Patient: So I got up, went for a walk and then I passed one of my friends so I ended up walking with her and I actually didn't get back to my house for like an hour. ; Patient: So I kind of put it off for like an hour because then I came home and took a couple hits. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you were able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana at least. ; Patient: It was rough. ; Therapist: It was rough? ; Patient: It was rough. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So it was difficult for you but in most cases you're able to hold off the 10 minutes. ; Therapist: And it sounds like there was a few instances where you're able to hold it off longer because something else kind of came up. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I actually talked to a couple people on the phone and before I knew it like a half hour had gone by. ; Therapist: So another activity presented itself and you forgot about the marijuana? ; Patient: Kind of. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I guess I just wasn't thinking about it. ; Therapist: So has your feelings about marijuana changed since we last talked? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: Tell me about that. ; Patient: I mean I don't see it as a problem. ; Patient: It's legal in a lot of states now and I mean it's not that bad for you. ; Patient: It doesn't really endanger me much. ; Therapist: So you still believe you should have the right to smoke marijuana? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean I'm not hurting anybody else. ; Therapist: But at the same time you want to go back to work and if I remember right, you're the person that you could go work for. ; Therapist: I guess you know them, right? ; Patient: Yeah, it's my uncle. ; Therapist: Your uncle. ; Therapist: And you need to be clean for, what is it, about two months? ; Patient: Yeah, I think two to three months. ; Therapist: So you have kind of opposing forces here, right? ; Therapist: You have your enjoyment of the marijuana and then you, you know, that's something you like, you don't want to give up and you believe you should have a right to do that. ; Therapist: But then there's that job. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean my parents are pretty cool with it. ; Patient: They know but I mean I'm at the point now where they kind of want me to move on and move out. ; Patient: But I don't know. ; Patient: I mean it'd be nice to have that job. ; Patient: I think it's a really good job but at the same time like I don't see why I have to sacrifice something that I like. ; Therapist: So it doesn't seem fair to you but you recognize it's the reality of your situation. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So it really does come down in your instance to marijuana use or employment. ; Patient: Yeah, it's pretty accurate. ; Therapist: So you're not happy about that choice. ; Patient: Not at all. ; Therapist: And kind of what we did with the postponed gratification was just, I mean I really just asked you to wait 10 minutes and you were able to do that and more, although it was difficult. ; Patient: It was difficult. ; Therapist: It was difficult for you. ; Therapist: So I asked you to track the number of times you smoked marijuana. ; Therapist: Were you able to track that over the last week? ; Patient: Yeah, for the most part. ; Therapist: Do you remember how many times that was? ; Patient: I think I did like 15, 15, 15, and 20. ; Therapist: Between 15 and 20. ; Therapist: And how many times did something kind of get in the way? ; Therapist: Did something else come up in that 10 minute span that distracted you or that you enjoyed? ; Patient: I would say 10. ; Patient: Like almost closer to 20 times I guess. ; Patient: Otherwise I probably would have kept going and smoked more. ; Patient: I mean there were a couple times where somebody would call me or somebody would text me and that kind of distracted me. ; Patient: So I would have put it off for a little bit. ; Therapist: So you can see in that 10 minutes things can happen. ; Therapist: Things can happen that can help you to avoid the marijuana. ; Therapist: Sometimes nothing does and after the 10 minutes you use it and sometimes something does kind of get in the way with the marijuana, like distract you or you have another activity that you enjoy and then you didn't use. ; Therapist: So with that in mind, you found the experience rough but was it tolerable? ; Patient: Yeah, it wasn't bad. ; Therapist: Was it bad? ; Therapist: Do you think for this next week we could try postponing that gratification from 10 minutes to 20 minutes? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: That seems kind of, that seems like a longer time. ; Therapist: That is definitely, that is a longer time. ; Patient: I don't know about that. ; Patient: Maybe like 15 minutes. ; Therapist: You want to compromise at 15? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You think you could maintain 15 minutes, weigh 15? ; Patient: I think I could try a little bit more than 20. ; Patient: It would be a little easier than 20. ; Therapist: Alright, so let's go with 15 minutes. ; Therapist: So 15 minutes as compared to 10, that will give you 5 extra minutes that something could happen that could distract you and you wouldn't use in that instance, right? ; Therapist: There's also, you know, to constructively use that time, you could consider alternatives like you mentioned walking, right? ; Therapist: You could use that time and start walking. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Anything else that you, like maybe in the past on occasion when you wanted to use marijuana but you didn't have anything available, what would you do instead, if anything? ; Patient: Binge watch TV. ; Therapist: Watch TV? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, so perhaps in that 15 minute time period, that time you're delaying using marijuana, you could start watching a show that you like? ; Patient: Yeah, I could do that. ; Therapist: At the end of 15 minutes, you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching the show. ; Therapist: So do you see kind of how it works? ; Therapist: Like is it making sense to you, the postponing? ; Patient: Yeah, it doesn't make it any easier but... ; Therapist: It's tough for you, yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: No, I definitely see how it helps. ; Therapist: And maybe if we're successful with the 15, who knows, we could move it up from there. ; Patient: Maybe. ; Patient: We'll see how the 15 goes. ; Therapist: We'll see how it goes with the 15, yeah. ; Therapist: We'll see how that goes. ; Therapist: You know, I'm hoping, and I hope this kind of makes sense, that there'll be a point where you'll be really interfering with the vast majority of the times that you use marijuana. ; Therapist: Because you're giving yourself that many more opportunities the longer you wait. ; Therapist: The more minutes you wait, the more opportunities for something else to get in the way, so to speak. ; Therapist: And probably what you'll see, just like you saw this last week, is you used marijuana less frequently just by waiting the 10 minutes. ; Therapist: Even though you describe it as difficult, and I'm sure it was, but there were a few times where it kind of worked out. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So I think that planning something for that time would be helpful. ; Therapist: Try to plan something for 15 minutes. ; Therapist: Even if you fully intend at the end of the 15 to go right and use, I think it's still useful to plan something in there. ; Therapist: And you never know what all that might take you. ; Therapist: You might end up walking or watching TV or doing something else that would distract you or pull you away from the marijuana use. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So does that sound like a plan? ; Patient: Yeah, I think I can give that a try. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: I think it would be the same thing if you could kind of write down the number of times that you used, like mark each time you used, and kind of what happened in terms of the 15 minute wait. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Actually, I guess more accurately, every time that you initiate a 15 minute wait period would be a good time to note it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right, because the idea is that something's going to come up and that you're going to have an opportunity to distance yourself from the use and you won't use as much. ; Therapist: So I want to kind of get an idea of the thought process that's occurring as you start that 15 minute, right, and if you end up using, what happened then, if you end up not using, kind of like the outcome for each possible scenario. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And then we can kind of analyze that and we can see if moving the minutes up would be ; Therapist: something we could do. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that sound like a plan? ; Patient: Yeah, I think I can manage that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: We'll go with that and I'll see you in a week. ; Patient: Okay.",

; Patient: I guess I would say like every other weekend maybe every two weeks on occasion maybe if there's a basketball game going on or a football game I'll have a beer just to drink with my boys but other than that I don't really see it as much of a problem. ; Therapist: So you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend? ; Patient: Yeah I guess you can say that. ; Therapist: How would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don't? ; Patient: When I'm not drinking I'm usually more involved in doing more productive things like I try and do more school work whenever I have the time or whenever I can go work out or something just to like whenever I'm drinking I devote my time to just letting loose and having fun and just relaxing with friends. ; Therapist: So you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends when you don't drink but maybe you don't feel like you can relax as well. ; Patient: Yeah I mean whenever I'm drinking I know that I'm devoting time to not doing other things so I try and make it so that I don't allow myself to pile on so much work so I try and like get work done before but I know that drinking gets in the way of productivity so I try and minimize that as much as possible. ; Therapist: You're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done knowing that the drinking is going to make it harder. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay and but it sounds like are you getting everything done or is some stuff sort of slipping when you drink? ; Patient: Yeah I guess when I drink some things do slip a little bit but just because like when I'm drinking I'm not really focused on what I have to do I'm focused on the moment and just enjoying the time that I have at that time and it's really something that I just it's something of a pleasure giver it's like an enjoyment type of thing. ; Therapist: What are the things you enjoy about the drinking? ; Patient: Just the way that it it sort of like liberates you it makes you it makes you feel like a more confident more energetic person that you don't feel like yourself you feel like a different version of yourself and it's something that you it it's just empowering to a degree. ; Therapist: Okay so you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways? ; Patient: Yeah yeah. ; Therapist: Are there any not so good things about drinking? ; Patient: Whenever I drink too much I sort of lose control of myself and I I just like the aftermath of whenever I drink too much or whenever I my friends mix drinks and it just has a harmful effect on my body and that's probably one of the major drawbacks that I have from drinking. ; Therapist: What kinds of things happen? ; Patient: I mainly when when I puke or it's just the the feeling that I get in my stomach if I drink too much is just very overwhelming. ; Therapist: So like you notice it in your body? ; Patient: Oh yeah definitely. ; Therapist: How much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time? ; Patient: Wow I would say probably at a friend one of my friends had a birthday party recently and he wanted to let loose it was it was just a all the guys were together and they had a couple of friends over and it just turned into one big party and I just I lost it I drank way too much I would say like probably a bottle or two and just some beers along the way like it got to a point where I lost count. ; Therapist: That was out of the ordinary for you to lose count. ; Therapist: What's a more typical amount that you drink? ; Patient: I don't let myself drink more than three or four beers on a given night just because I know I've gotten to the point where I sort of know my limit but I kind of flirt with my limit just to see how far I can go and I think that that sort of is very dangerous to play with fire but I want to see how far I can go just so I know not to go that far. ; Therapist: Got it. ; Therapist: So you're sort of testing and pushing it and sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned before. ; Patient: Yeah just so I know how it feels now so that later on when this situation is more drastic and more out of control I know what I can do or where my limit is at. ; Therapist: Okay well kind of along those lines looking ahead you know five years from now what do you see as a goal for yourself? ; Patient: In terms of career wise? ; Therapist: Yeah in terms of what do you think you'll be doing in five years? ; Patient: I would love to be I would love to travel I would love to see the world for what it is and I've always seen pictures and videos of how the world is but I've never really experienced that like I've always wanted to travel to Europe or China or someplace like that so I can really experience the world that we live in. ; Therapist: So getting a full experience is really important to you it sounds like throughout your life you know you talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience and now you're looking ahead to think of how you can enrich your life in other ways. ; Therapist: How do you think drinking too much would fit into you know being able to experience life to its fullest? ; Patient: I guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effects of living life to the fullest but I wouldn't want to tamper with drinking too much like often just because I know I've seen the consequences that drinking has on people and I know that I would never want to get to a degree where I need to drink constantly every single day. ; Patient: I don't want to ever get to that point. ; Therapist: So just to kind of summarize what you've told me so far you're drinking pretty regularly but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences and you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less. ; Patient: Yeah I feel more in control. ; Therapist: And then kind of looking ahead you don't want to find yourself being someone who's drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control with their drinking that you've seen that maybe in other people's lives and it's not appealing to you at all. ; Therapist: And you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve that drinking too much could also interfere with. ; Therapist: So where do you think you want to go from here with regard to your drinking? ; Patient: Maybe now that I know my limits to an extent I kind of don't want to push it so much. ; Patient: Now that I know what I can do and where I can go I would like to mitigate that as much as possible. ; Patient: I just want to have fun being me but I don't want me to be influenced by alcohol so much. ; Patient: Like I want to live the sober life to an extent but I know that alcohol is just going to tamper with that. ; Therapist: So for right now it feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you're stopping at three for example or maybe even limiting the number of times that you're drinking. ; Patient: Yeah and like not drinking in the mornings or just strictly for social purposes. ; Patient: Just to not have it around like I don't want to have it in my fridge if my parents have it. ; Patient: I don't want to have to deal with that. ; Therapist: What do you see as some benefits to that? ; Patient: Benefits in terms of? ; Therapist: To sticking to those limits. ; Patient: I guess I could definitely be, I could live a more fulfilled life to an extent. ; Patient: Like I could possibly be more productive, more efficient in my work and where I can possibly be in the next few years of my life. ; Patient: I think that by not drinking it will definitely have a better effect on my life. ; Therapist: Yeah well I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea. ; Therapist: I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest. ; Patient: My pleasure. ; Therapist: You know if you don't mind I would like to talk to you probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months and just kind of check in how things are going. ; Patient: Alright sounds good. ; Therapist: Thank you very much. ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: This time the youth ministry began by expressing concern but relied on open questions and reflective listening to build rapport and encourage Tommy to share his experiences. ; Therapist: Tommy provided a great deal of useful information regarding his drinking very quickly which set the stage for a more productive conversation. ; Therapist: By exploring both sides of the issue, Tommy was given the opportunity to open up without fear of condemnation and was also able to admit to some of the consequences of his drinking. ; Therapist: This gave him the chance to consider the reasons he might benefit from making a change. ; Therapist: The youth minister also encouraged Tommy to look ahead to consider how his drinking could affect his future plans. ; Therapist: By exploring his values and relating them to his drinking, she developed a discrepancy between his future goals and his current behaviors, highlighting the need to make some adjustments to his drinking. ; Therapist: Using a summary, the youth minister was able to transition smoothly to a discussion of options and Tommy identified a realistic goal for himself that matched his values. ; Therapist: As a result, he is much more likely to follow through on his plans and actually make a change in his drinking. ; Therapist: .",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: How you doing today? ; Patient: I'm alright. ; Therapist: You alright? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: There's been some changes in my life, but, um, yeah. ; Therapist: Good changes? ; Patient: Eh, not really. ; Therapist: Not really? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What kind of changes? ; Patient: You know, just, you know, you know I lost my job, so things are kinda, you know, domino effects from that, so. ; Therapist: So there's been consequences from those in your job? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean obviously, that's, you know, you have a job, so you can take care of certain things, so. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Like what things? ; Patient: Like, you know, like paying your bills, and that's pretty much it, I guess that's really why most people have a job. ; Therapist: So you've been unable to pay your bills? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: How's your mood overall? ; Patient: I mean, what can I say? ; Patient: I lost my job. ; Patient: I'm seeing you because I have a drinking problem, so things are not that great. ; Therapist: Things are not great? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Tell me about the drinking now. ; Therapist: How's it been going? ; Patient: I drink a lot. ; Patient: Um, I always say to myself that I'll try to drink less, but at this point it's kind of like, what have I got to lose, you know? ; Therapist: Are you drinking more? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: A lot more? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, not a lot more, I mean I guess I have more free time now, so. ; Patient: Because of not having a job. ; Therapist: What effects do you think that you're experiencing because of the increased drinking? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: Are you feeling good about the drinking? ; Patient: At this point it's kind of like, who cares, like what difference does it really make, you know? ; Therapist: So you're indifferent towards the drinking? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: When you're drinking does it still feel good? ; Patient: Nothing really feels good. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Does it just get you back to normal? ; Patient: Yeah, pretty much. ; Therapist: When's the last time you drank? ; Patient: This morning. ; Therapist: And how much? ; Patient: A lot, I don't know. ; Therapist: You don't recall? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Is that typical? ; Patient: I mean, I don't recall you drinking on the same day that we've had sessions before. ; Patient: I mean, at a certain point it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. ; Patient: Like to get through the day. ; Patient: So, yeah, I mean I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. ; Patient: Like I don't sit there and count it like, these are my three shots for the morning. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. ; Patient: I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like get out of bed without having a drink. ; Patient: So I'll drink some then, you know, and just to function. ; Patient: So I don't know how much. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: But you feel as though it's worsened, like you're drinking more. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now? ; Patient: I'm pretty indifferent, like I said. ; Patient: I mean, I just don't, I don't, at this point it's like, what does it matter? ; Patient: Like everything else has, I don't know. ; Therapist: So a couple of times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it, right? ; Therapist: And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way that you've appeared before. ; Therapist: You appeared before to be unhappy that you were drinking. ; Therapist: And now it's more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other. ; Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering and like making myself suffer. ; Therapist: So the drinking takes away the suffering. ; Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer. ; Therapist: The feeling bad about the drinking. ; Patient: And yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering, but that's not what I meant. ; Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, that's what's causing you problems. ; Patient: That, I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems, but at this point it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it is what I'm saying. ; Therapist: How would you like to feel about it? ; Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. ; Patient: I would like to not drink. ; Patient: I would like to have a good life. ; Patient: But at this point I'd rather just, I don't know, like why should I keep feeling guilty about it? ; Patient: What is the point? ; Patient: Like what is the point of this life where I have no job and I'm going to lose my house and, you know, I just don't get it. ; Patient: Like why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? ; Patient: It's not working. ; Patient: And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. ; Patient: I don't get that anymore. ; Patient: I don't get it. ; Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. ; Patient: As it is, like this just doesn't make any sense to me. ; Patient: Like why should I keep fighting to be sober if I can't, you know, I lost my job. ; Patient: It's too late for that. ; Patient: Like the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life. ; Patient: Things are getting worse. ; Patient: I'm not saying it's your fault. ; Patient: I'm just saying like what's the point of this if it's not getting better? ; Patient: And things are getting so bad that even if I was sober I wouldn't be able to handle it. ; Therapist: So what do you see as your options right now? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about some of the things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days? ; Patient: Sitting at home drinking? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: That's about it. ; Patient: A lot of drinking. ; Therapist: Anything else? ; Patient: Yeah, going to the liquor store. ; Patient: That's about it. ; Patient: I mean, seriously, it's just funny. ; Patient: Like I don't even... ; Patient: There is nothing. ; Therapist: Now I know you were working on a few things, like you were working on finding another job. ; Therapist: Have you been doing that? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Patient: I mean, I'm going to lose my house, so I'm just biding my time until that happens. ; Patient: I don't really know. ; Patient: Like, yeah, no. ; Patient: I'm not looking for a job, no. ; Therapist: So you stopped looking for a job. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And when are you losing your house? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: It's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems like it will be soon. ; Therapist: And what's your plan for when that happens? ; Patient: I don't have one. ; Therapist: You don't have one? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Now, before we've talked, and I haven't seen you in a while, you're always pretty careful about planning things out. ; Patient: I've just decided that I'm not going to worry about it anymore. ; Patient: I can't. ; Patient: I just can't do it anymore. ; Therapist: You can't worry anymore? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: My whole life is just full of worrying. ; Patient: I mean, there's nothing to do except to worry about all of it, you know, my job, my drinking, my house. ; Therapist: So what do you see as your alternative to all this worrying? ; Patient: There is no alternative. ; Therapist: So what do you do? ; Therapist: You don't know? ; Therapist: I sense at this time you're much more negativistic as compared to what I've seen you before. ; Therapist: Do you recognize that as being the case? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Like, markedly so. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Like, I feel like things have taken a turn. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about that turn? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I just feel like, you know, I'm losing my house, I lost my job, I don't really have anything that needs to be gotten in order. ; Therapist: Got in order for what? ; Patient: Just, you know, in general, like, I don't know, in my own life, like, if something were to happen to me, there wouldn't be anything that needed to be taken care of. ; Therapist: What's going to happen to you? ; Patient: Like if I died. ; Therapist: If you died. ; Therapist: If you died, nothing would have to be taken care of? ; Patient: I mean, like... ; Patient: I mean, they probably have a funeral, but, you know, my house is gone, my job is gone, my drinking will be gone. ; Therapist: Would your family miss you? ; Patient: I don't really care. ; Therapist: Even still, do you think they would miss you? ; Patient: Maybe. ; Patient: I mean, in their own way. ; Patient: They probably would have wished that they would have done different things differently, yeah, but that's not my responsibility. ; Therapist: What's your responsibility right now? ; Patient: Nothing. ; Therapist: Nothing? ; Patient: Nothing. ; Patient: Nothing. ; Patient: I mean... ; Therapist: So, no one would, correct me if I'm wrong, no one would care if you died? ; Patient: I mean, they probably care a little bit. ; Patient: Do I care if they cared? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: So you care a little, but you're not concerned with that. ; Therapist: And you have this sense that you have nothing left to lose because you lost the job, and now, soon, your house. ; Therapist: Do you have anything else that you care about? ; Therapist: Any goals? ; Patient: I used to. ; Therapist: How about now? ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: What happened to your goals? ; Patient: I drank them away. ; Patient: I lost my job. ; Patient: I lost my house. ; Patient: You know, I was thinking maybe I could find myself a new job, but at this point, I'm just so far gone, like my life is so ruined. ; Patient: I don't know how you could expect me to come back from this. ; Patient: I don't know how you can expect me to live a life, how to pick this up and make something of it, like... ; Patient: How to redeem yourself. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You can't see a way to do that now. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I mean, come on. ; Therapist: Because all the things that happened to you overwhelmed you. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, happened to me, did to myself. ; Patient: It's just, at this point, it's like I've lost so much of what I worked for, and I don't have one scrap of dignity or anything at all. ; Patient: I don't have anything. ; Therapist: You don't have anything. ; Therapist: You don't have any worth. ; Therapist: Worthless. ; Therapist: That's how you're feeling? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Alone. ; Patient: Worthless. ; Patient: Yeah, like nothing... There's nothing redeemable. ; Patient: There's nothing I can build upon. ; Therapist: So you've lost everything. ; Therapist: You're worthless, and you can't be redeemed. ; Therapist: So of all the time I've been treating you, this is the most severe I've seen in your hopelessness. ; Therapist: Would that be accurate? ; Patient: This situation is more dire than I ever thought that I would have to experience. ; Patient: You know, when I started seeing you, I thought, this is as bad as it can get, and I have to fix things now, or, you know, I can't go on like this. ; Patient: Like, I can't... This is as bad as my life can get, and I cannot let it continue to get any worse. ; Patient: But things have gotten worse, and... Yeah. ; Therapist: Aaron, have you been thinking about ending your life? ; Therapist: Are you hesitant to tell me that? ; Therapist: Why is that? ; Patient: I guess... a lot of reasons. ; Patient: Um... I know that we have worked together, and I don't want you to feel like you've failed. ; Patient: I really don't want you to try to do anything, because I feel like nothing that you have tried has worked. ; Patient: You know, I'm a hopeless case, and I feel like at this point it shouldn't even be your responsibility to try, because it's not fair to you anymore. ; Patient: And... I don't know, I just... ; Therapist: Are you planning on ending your life? ; Therapist: Like, do you have a plan in place? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about the plan? ; Patient: I don't really want to talk about it. ; Therapist: But you have a plan. ; Therapist: You don't want me to interfere in your plan. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No, obviously not. ; Therapist: But you're aware that I'm going to try to interfere with your plan. ; Patient: I guess so. ; Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you just... I mean, it sounds like what you're saying is you've hit rock bottom. ; Therapist: And rock bottom can't be tolerated. ; Therapist: And... your family would care if they lost you, but you're indifferent to that. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: I would care if you died. ; Therapist: Alright? ; Therapist: I'm going to do everything I can to prevent that. ; Therapist: It's hard to see when you have thoughts of worthlessness. ; Therapist: It's hard to see strengths. ; Therapist: But I see something with strengths. ; Therapist: I see a young lady that over the last few months has told me about all kinds of strengths. ; Therapist: All kinds of situations where you've been resilient. ; Therapist: Do you recall those conversations? ; Patient: I guess. ; Therapist: But that's not in the forefront of your mind right now, your strengths. ; Therapist: But they're still there. ; Therapist: Do you have an intent to commit suicide? ; Therapist: And you don't want me to stop you? ; Therapist: I'm going to stop you. ; Therapist: Alright? ; Therapist: I want to, I'm obligated to, and it's really the best thing to be done. ; Therapist: Is to prevent it. ; Therapist: I know you feel this way now, and I know I can't fully understand that. ; Therapist: But I'm fairly sure that you won't feel this way a week or two from now. ; Therapist: Feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hitting rock bottom, they cycle just like all feelings. ; Therapist: You've had ups and downs before. ; Therapist: Remember? ; Therapist: I see somebody with a long and productive life ahead of them. ; Therapist: Suicide's not the answer. ; Therapist: I know it seems like the only option right now. ; Therapist: I get that. ; Therapist: But there's still some other options. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Therapist: I know you probably don't want to hear about other options. ; Therapist: I think what we should do today is get you over as an impatient. ; Therapist: Alright? ; Therapist: And they'll probably keep you for five, ten days. ; Therapist: And kind of work on getting your mood stable. ; Therapist: My guess is when you come out, you'll feel differently on this subject. ; Therapist: You'll feel a little better. ; Therapist: Maybe a little better place where you can continue. ; Therapist: And we will. ; Therapist: I'll see you, we'll schedule this, I'll see you on the day, or the day after you come out. ; Therapist: Preferably on the same day. ; Therapist: Does that make sense to you? ; Patient: I mean, I guess. ; Therapist: Are you disappointed that I'm trying to save your life? ; Therapist: Do you understand why I'm doing it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So I'm going to walk you over to one of the other counselors. ; Therapist: I'm going to make some phone calls. ; Therapist: And we'll get you over there, okay? ; Patient: Alright. ; Therapist: Thanks, Aaron.",

; Patient: Yeah, I have a lot of stuff. ; Therapist: You have a lot of stuff? ; Patient: Yeah, a lot of stuff. ; Therapist: Like where you live? ; Patient: Yeah, my house is full of things and it's kind of embarrassing. ; Patient: I don't like to get rid of things. ; Patient: I worry that I'm going to need them or something. ; Patient: So yeah, it's overflowing my house with stuff. ; Therapist: So there's a lot of stuff in your house and this is affecting your relationships? ; Patient: Yeah, you know, all the stuff is taking over my house. ; Patient: There's no room for anyone to really come over and visit me which has really become your problem. ; Patient: You meet people and it's normal to go over to their house and have lunch or whatever. ; Patient: And I get really embarrassed. ; Patient: I don't want people to do that. ; Patient: I don't want my family even coming over. ; Patient: My sister was over last week and she threw something away. ; Patient: She threw this newspaper away from two years ago and I freaked out. ; Patient: What if I need that? ; Patient: Those things are important to me. ; Patient: So that's kind of putting a strain on my relationship with my family in that way. ; Patient: I think they're the only ones probably that would feel brave enough to actually do something like my sister did. ; Therapist: To throw something away? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, so it's embarrassing that I can't have my friends over. ; Patient: What it's like to have my family over and I just can't. ; Patient: I don't know what to do. ; Therapist: So you mentioned your house is overflowing. ; Therapist: How cluttered can you describe it? ; Patient: There's room for me to live in there. ; Patient: There's a path from my front door to the kitchen, to the bedroom and the bathroom. ; Patient: Sometimes it's blocked by stuff but when things fall or whatever, pretty much my whole house is full of things. ; Therapist: What type of things? ; Therapist: You mentioned a newspaper. ; Patient: I don't like to get rid of cards or newspapers or magazines, mail, things like that. ; Patient: But I've also collected things over the years. ; Patient: I inherited the house from my grandmother so all her stuff was in there. ; Patient: I really can't get rid of that. ; Patient: It has a lot of sentimental value to me. ; Patient: My things have just been piled up on her things. ; Therapist: So you have a lot of stuff in the house and it's congested but you're able to move around and live there. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm not freely able to move around but it works for me. ; Therapist: But it'd be difficult or it is difficult when other people come by. ; Patient: Yes, they wouldn't really be able to be in there. ; Therapist: Some of these items you said you received when you received the house, do you ever go out and buy things and bring them in? ; Patient: Yeah, I like to go shopping. ; Patient: I like to get the yard sales on the weekends. ; Patient: I'm kind of a deal hunter so if I see something on sale I don't want to pass it up. ; Patient: If it's a good deal I might not be able to come back to it. ; Patient: I do like to buy things. ; Therapist: How often do you buy things? ; Patient: I probably like, on the weekends I go to yard sales. ; Patient: I usually buy a few things every weekend from yard sales. ; Patient: They're such good deals. ; Patient: I make a trip to the mall or DJ Maxx once a week at least. ; Patient: So I usually buy something then too. ; Therapist: Does your vehicle have stuff in it now that you bought?

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, this is Dr. Grande. ; Therapist: I hope you find this video useful. ; Therapist: If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel. ; Therapist: As always, thanks for watching. ; Therapist: Well, I could see these types of decisions where you're talking about potentially breaking families up and having real consequences to families. ; Therapist: I could see how these decisions could be... ; Therapist: I mean, I'm sure there's guidelines you are supposed to follow that you really don't have a whole lot of choice in. ; Therapist: But you could also really agonize and overanalyze a decision like that because the consequences are so great. ; Therapist: You feel like that could be happening? ; Patient: Yeah, I think so. ; Patient: I mean, you're right to a certain extent, we have guidelines and everything like that, but I also feel like certain things that just isn't black and white and I have to make a judgment call. ; Patient: And I used to trust my judgment, but now I feel like, how do I know that I'm making the right decisions? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, and this is really one of the key parts of what may be causing this distress is, we talked about this insecurity, you're unsure. ; Therapist: So one question may be, did you make an efficient or less efficient decision with this particular family? ; Therapist: But the larger question is, you as a person, can you do this job? ; Therapist: And if you do it and make a mistake, what do you do then? ; Therapist: Could you go through this again? ; Patient: Yeah, I think that's where the fear is, is that if 99 times out of 100 I do it right, there's still going to be that one that I messed up. ; Patient: And I'm starting to feel like that one mistake could be life-changing for somebody. ; Therapist: And it could be. ; Therapist: Yeah, you're certainly in a job where, like most jobs where mistakes have consequences, you also do a lot of good for a lot of people. ; Therapist: So by you not being in the field, they're not getting the benefit of the skills you have. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I guess that's true. ; Patient: Like, yeah, maybe somebody else could come and replace me, but do I think that they would be better at it? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I feel like I was pretty good at it before I started to have all these doubts. ; Therapist: So mostly this was good until this incident. ; Therapist: Well, all right, let's look at this from another point of view. ; Therapist: You really seem like you can empathize with these families. ; Therapist: To me, it seems like you really know what they're feeling. ; Patient: Yeah, I care about them. ; Therapist: And appreciating their perspective, take a moment and try to walk in their shoes. ; Therapist: If a professional like yourself came to you in your family situation, and maybe you're engaged in the activities where it was warranted that your family be broken up temporarily, what would you want, how would you want them to process that? ; Therapist: Like you're thinking about the caseworker from the point of view of the family. ; Therapist: How would you want them to feel that? ; Therapist: How would you want them to process that decision? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: That's a hard question. ; Patient: I mean, if they took my kids away, even if it was the right thing, I would want them to be at least a little bit, you know, feel a little bit bad about having to make such a hard decision. ; Patient: But I guess if they fell apart every time that they made that kind of decision, they wouldn't be able to help other people. ; Therapist: So from the family's point of view, if you're in that situation, you can appreciate what the caseworker has to do, but you'd like them to have some compassion for you. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That seems reasonable. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So now flip back into the role you're in. ; Therapist: You made a decision you had to make, although you're second-guessing it. ; Therapist: That's separate. ; Therapist: Do you have compassion for them? ; Patient: For the families that I took, yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I think that might be the problem is I have too much of it, you know? ; Patient: I worry about how they feel, even if maybe taking the kids away was the right thing. ; Patient: It's just like so devastating to lose your kids, whether you're doing the right things or not, you know? ; Patient: You want your kids with you. ; Patient: You want to be able to take care of them, even if you're not doing a really good job at it.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Andy, do you want to come on in and have a seat? ; Therapist: I'm Dr Taylor, I'm the on-call psychiatrist for this afternoon. ; Therapist: I got a call this morning from your family doctor, because I think you went to see him this morning along with your mum, and I gather that things have been a little bit difficult for you, you've had some other distressing experiences, so I think your doctor thought it might be helpful for us to have a bit of a discussion about that, to see if I could help. ; Therapist: Would that be alright with you? ; Patient: No, it's fine. ; Therapist: Would it be alright Andy for you to tell me a little bit about what's been going on? ; Patient: Well, you're going to think it sounds stupid, but my housemates are working for MI5, and they're doing stuff to my brain, and they're out to get me. ; Therapist: OK, that must be very difficult for you. ; Therapist: How long has this been going on for Andy? ; Patient: About two months. ; Therapist: And how did you first work out that this was happening? ; Patient: I came home one time and moved the TV to the other side of the room, and I knew then. ; Therapist: What was it that you knew at that moment? ; Patient: That they were for MI5. ; Therapist: Right, OK. ; Therapist: So it's been going on a couple of months? ; Patient: Yeah, this new lecturer started at uni, and he worked for MI5, and he basically drafted me housemates in, turned them against me. ; Therapist: OK, OK. ; Therapist: Now I've noticed a couple of times while we've been talking that you've sort of looked round you into the room as if you're checking for something. ; Therapist: Could I ask you what's happening at those times? ; Patient: Well, I can hear them talking about me. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Who is it you can hear? ; Patient: My housemates. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So that you recognise it as their voices? ; Patient: Yeah, I can hear them all the time. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: How many voices can you hear, Andy? ; Patient: Three, there's three of them. ; Therapist: OK, and do they sound real, like my voice sounds, talking to you now? ; Patient: Yeah, it's odd. ; Patient: It's like I can hear them when they're not here. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So when they're not in the house with you? ; Patient: Yeah, it's like they're in the other room or something. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And can you hear what they're actually saying? ; Patient: Yeah, they're talking about me. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: They're always talking about me. ; Patient: They're always commenting on everything that I'm doing. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Can you give me an example of what they would say? ; Patient: Well, like if I'm packing me back to go to uni or something, they'll comment on that, like you've left the house now. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: Anything else? ; Therapist: Do they ever talk to each other, perhaps, about you? ; Patient: Yeah, that's what they do. ; Patient: I mean, and now they know the sort of twig that I know about them now. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: They're saying like I'm making trouble. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: And that they're going to sort me out. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: What about actually talking directly to you in the way that I'm talking to you now? ; Therapist: Does that ever happen, Andy? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So you've been hearing the voices of your housemates. ; Therapist: Have there been any other changes? ; Therapist: Have there been any changes, perhaps, to the way you're thinking? ; Therapist: Sometimes people tell us that they're thinking changes in some way. ; Therapist: So, for example, they might feel that they're getting thoughts put into their head that aren't their own. ; Therapist: Have you had any experiences like that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I do think things that aren't me. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: Like they're putting stuff in my brain. ; Patient: It's not me. ; Patient: I'm not thinking. ; Therapist: So different thoughts in your brain. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: It's stupid stuff as well. ; Patient: It's like the other day I suddenly just started thinking about some woman in Carnation Street. ; Patient: I don't watch any of that crap. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: It's not your kind of thing normally. ; Patient: They're not my thoughts. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And do you have any idea how that's happening? ; Therapist: Or who's responsible? ; Patient: It's MI5. ; Patient: It's this chip they're putting in my head. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: And I can feel it all the time. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So you're getting thoughts put into your brain that aren't your own. ; Therapist: What about a different sort of experience? ; Therapist: What about the experience that somehow other people are able to know what you're thinking even though you haven't actually told them? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: They're just putting stuff in my head. ; Therapist: Just putting stuff. ; Therapist: And can I just check Andy as well that you're not getting the experience when your thoughts just stop altogether like you have no thoughts left? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: If anything, there's too much in there. ; Patient: I wish I could unplug it. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: Just get this thing out of my head. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And you mentioned this chip or this device in your brain. ; Therapist: Do you want to tell me a bit more about that? ; Patient: Well, it's a tracking device so they know where I am at all times and I can feel it moving around, like rotating around. ; Therapist: So you can feel the physical sensation in your brain? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: That must be very difficult for you. ; Patient: I don't know why they're doing this to me. ; Patient: I've done nothing wrong. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: Can I just check? ; Therapist: Are there any problems, Andy, with the rest of your body? ; Therapist: Any changes in sensation or any bits that feel different in any way? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I feel fine. ; Patient: I'm not ill or anything. ; Patient: I just want this thing out of my head. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: It sounds like a very difficult time for you. ; Therapist: Can I ask you, Andy, how are you coping with all this? ; Therapist: How is it affecting you? ; Patient: Well, I know we're leaving my room much and I sort of have to wait until they go out to go down and get some food. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: But they've been doing stuff to my food now. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: What do you think is happening to your food? ; Patient: The poison in it. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Are you actually eating much at the moment? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Now, with all this happening, and this sounds like you don't feel very safe, have I got that right? ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Have you felt the need, I don't know, to take steps to protect yourself in any way? ; Patient: Well, I've got a knife. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: And I've got like a baseball bat. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: It's just in case they get in my room. ; Patient: I just don't want to hurt anyone. ; Patient: I just feel like I've got to protect myself. ; Patient: It's like cornering me to do this. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Have you felt the need to use either the knife or the baseball bat so far? ; Therapist: I'll take it out with you for protection. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No, I don't want to get caught. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: It's just in my room. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Has it ever got so bad, Andy, that you've felt the need to hurt yourself or even kill yourself as the only way out, the only way of coping with this? ; Patient: Well, I thought about getting some pills, but I couldn't leave the house, so I didn't get anything. ; Therapist: And when you say getting some pills, would that be to take an overdose of tablets? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: But you've not actually done anything about that so far. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: In the past, have you ever had any problems either with your temper or getting into fights, being aggressive, either with your housemates or anybody else? ; Patient: No, I'm not that kind of person. ; Patient: I don't want to hurt anybody. ; Patient: They're just driving me to this. ; Therapist: And can I just check again? ; Therapist: You've not been in trouble with the police or anything like that? ; Therapist: No, never. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: With all this that's going on, is there anywhere at the moment, Andy, that you feel safe? ; Patient: My parents' house. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And have you seen much of your parents recently? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I thought about going back there, but I don't want to drag them into this. ; Patient: I don't want them or if I've known about them. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And throughout this last couple of months, when you've had all these worries, have you ever worried that your parents might in some way be involved in this? ; Therapist: I thought about it, but no. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Can I just check out a couple of background things with you, Andy? ; Therapist: You're general health. ; Therapist: Is that OK? ; Therapist: You generally fit and well? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I'm not ill. ; Patient: There's nothing wrong with me. ; Patient: It's just this thing in my head. ; Therapist: And you're not on any regular medication from your own doctor at this stage? ; Patient: No, I don't take any pills. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: What about other drugs? ; Therapist: And by that I'm meaning alcohol, cannabis, pills, anything else? ; Patient: I don't drink much alcohol. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And what about drugs like cannabis? ; Patient: Is my mum going to know about this? ; Therapist: No, I think it's something that's important that I hear about, but this wouldn't be something we'd be discussing with your mum. ; Therapist: I smoke a bit of weed. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Would that be regularly for most days? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how much would you be spending on weed? ; Patient: I get like a ten bag, it lasts me a day or so. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So you have a ten bag lasting you a day of weed. ; Therapist: Any other drugs? ; Therapist: I'm thinking in particular things like speed or pills. ; Patient: I've done a bit of speed. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Is that on a regular basis, Andy? ; Patient: I was grabbing my mates for the weekend, we'd do a bit, but... ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: When was the last time, Andy, that you would have had any speed? ; Patient: About a week or so ago. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Any other drugs at all? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: But I know what you're getting at, though. ; Patient: It's not the drugs. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: This is... It doesn't matter how out my face I get, this is constantly there, it's always there. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: I guess the reason I was checking, I think is what you've picked up on, is that sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are, they find if they take certain drugs it can make things feel a lot worse. ; Therapist: I just wanted to check if that hadn't been your experience. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: I appreciate from what you're saying that you're really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that that's the cause of the difficulties that you're having at the moment. ; Therapist: I just wanted to check with you. ; Therapist: Do you think it could be due to anything else? ; Therapist: I mean, I've obviously met other people who've had similar experiences and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be actually mentally unwell. ; Therapist: And just whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment? ; Patient: No, because I'm not ill. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: It's them. ; Patient: And I've read books on this as well. ; Patient: I don't... The government know about them. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: They know that they do this to loads of people. ; Patient: I don't know how they can get away with it. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: I've done nothing wrong. ; Patient: I don't know why they're doing this to me. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: I just want it... I just want it to stop. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: And I think I can appreciate that. ; Therapist: I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor, that sometimes meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful. ; Therapist: Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment? ; Therapist: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, I'm only here really because I'm a warm-up. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: I've tried to... I don't want to worry her. ; Patient: I've tried to talk to her about it. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: And she doesn't understand. ; Patient: She doesn't really believe me. ; Patient: I mean, do you believe me? ; Therapist: Well, I certainly believe that you're having a really difficult time at the moment. ; Therapist: I guess what I'm not as sure about is what's causing this. ; Therapist: And I'm less sure this is due to MI5. ; Therapist: I guess what I'm wondering is that perhaps you're not as well as you might be at the moment. ; Therapist: I mean, we've been through a lot of questions and what I'm thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this. ; Therapist: So I'm wondering, because I know your mum is... I think she's waiting in the waiting room. ; Therapist: It might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some proper support. ; Therapist: Would that be alright if I got your mum in? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If you want to sit there then, Andy, I'll just get your mum. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Okay.",

; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a suicide attempt? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: It's a sin to kill yourself. ; Patient: Only God can take your soul away, so that's... ; Patient: No, you can't do that. ; Therapist: So no attempts. ; Therapist: Have you ever had thoughts of suicide? ; Patient: I mean, sometimes when I get really sad, I think that the world would be better without me, but I bring myself out of that. ; Patient: I don't think it's anything I'd ever do, but... ; Therapist: Not something you ever do, but sometimes a thought crosses your mind like that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you remember the last time a thought like that crossed your mind? ; Patient: We were getting evicted from our last place because I just felt like a complete failure. ; Therapist: How long ago was that? ; Patient: That was about a month and a half ago. ; Patient: Yeah, all my friends in the house turned against me because I couldn't pay rent. ; Patient: And it had been like the third month, but not consecutively, so I didn't see the big issue. ; Patient: And so they told me that if I didn't get out, they would call the police. ; Patient: And I had to stay with my sister, and then I just... ; Patient: I felt like a failure. ; Patient: I felt like a failure to myself, to my kids. ; Therapist: So it's a tough time for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you had some... ; Therapist: It sounds like maybe passing thoughts. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: But like I said, it's nothing I could ever do. ; Patient: Ever. ; Therapist: If that ever changes, would you tell me? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I'll tell you. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So how about harm to others? ; Therapist: Meaning... ; Therapist: Do you ever feel like you have thoughts or do you ever develop a plan to hurt someone else? ; Patient: When I was younger, not anymore. ; Therapist: When was the last time? ; Patient: Probably when I was in high school. ; Therapist: So a while back. ; Patient: Yeah, when I was still in that violent stage in my life, where I would fight. ; Patient: But I never went to anything like, I'll kill this person. ; Patient: It was always just, I'll knock you out, but I won't kill you. ; Therapist: That was a while ago. ; Therapist: Presently, no thoughts of harming anybody else. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: If I ever feel really, really angry, I just gonna punch a wall. ; Patient: I have special plates that I'll throw on the ground and break them. ; Therapist: Like the suicidal thoughts. ; Therapist: If thoughts of harming others do come up, would you tell me about those? ; Patient: Oh yeah. ; Patient: I don't want to go to jail over hurting somebody, so I'd tell you. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Therapist: Have you ever heard or seen anything that other people have not heard or seen? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Never? ; Therapist: How about under the influence of drugs? ; Patient: Well, when I used to do cocaine, sometimes I would like think that somebody's at the door and they're not at the door, like nobody's there. ; Patient: I think somebody's in the house when there's nobody in the house. ; Therapist: But not under the effect of drugs. ; Therapist: It never happened. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, I want to switch gears again. ; Therapist: I want to talk about, if you're okay with this, the goals for counseling. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So the goals that you want to meet by spending this time with me, you know, with treatment. ; Therapist: And your general goals, like your goals in life. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, let's start with, if you're okay, your goals in life in general. ; Patient: Hmm. ; Patient: Because I haven't really thought much about it, but I would like to just have a real, I mean, I don't care what the job is, just a nice cushy job. ; Therapist: A better job? ; Patient: Yeah, where I can just relax, you know, my kids will have a good future. ; Patient: I'll have a good future. ; Therapist: A better future for your children? ; Patient: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: Any other general life goals? ; Patient: I guess be drug free. ; Patient: Like I said, I'd really like to quit, but it's hard. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about goals specifically for counseling? ; Therapist: Like what you hope to get out of this counseling? ; Patient: I'd like to learn to be less angry. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: And bring my blood pressure down a little bit. ; Patient: Um, sleep more. ; Therapist: More sleep? ; Patient: Eat less. ; Patient: I don't know, I guess try to quit. ; Patient: Try to quit drugs. ; Therapist: Quitting drugs? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: How confident right now are you that you can meet these goals? ; Therapist: Specifically the counseling goals? ; Patient: Like, kind of, I guess, is that an answer? ; Therapist: It's an answer. ; Patient: Kind of. ; Therapist: Kind of confident. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, like I said, I haven't really moved forward anywhere every time I go to a counseling place, so I mean, I'm willing to give it another shot, but because of my history with it, it didn't really go anywhere in the first place, but I'm willing to try again. ; Therapist: Alright, so you're kind of confident and willing to try again. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So, throughout this intake, I've asked you a lot of questions. ; Therapist: I want to thank you for answering them. ; Therapist: Do you have any questions for me? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: So next time I see you, sorry, with you it would be about a week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm going to start with the actual counseling sessions. ; Therapist: So, I'll still have some questions, but not as many as I've asked today. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense, how it's structured? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright, so we've completed intake. ; Therapist: I'll still have some more questions, but we'll get to the counseling sessions. ; Therapist: Next week we'll get started working on specific details of what's happened to you and what might be causing it and how you can treat it. ; Patient: Alright. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So, I appreciate again you taking this time and answering these questions and I'll see you next week. ; Patient: Alright, thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks Rhonda.",

; Patient: Yeah, I mean, it's making me think like, you know, if I just had some desk job, like if I just crunched numbers or something, I would never have to have this responsibility. ; Patient: Like, why would they trust me with a job like this? ; Patient: Like I'm just a human being who, you know, doesn't know any better than any other person and I just don't know if I can do this. ; Patient: It's just so much responsibility and I guess, I guess before I felt like I could handle it and now I just feel like it's so much responsibility for one person and I don't think that I can handle it anymore. ; Patient: But I don't want to change jobs because I've been here for so long and I liked it before and I don't know. ; Therapist: You're fearful of this happening again. ; Patient: Yes, yes. ; Therapist: And how you may handle it, what may happen. ; Patient: I feel like it's just around the corner and this isn't even resolved. ; Patient: I'm still afraid of the consequences of this, you know, like what if, you know, these kids are out of their parents' home and I just feel like what if something bad happens to them where they are now and then that's going to fall on me and, you know, people like other, my coworkers know that I'm the one that did this. ; Patient: So like if something happens to the kids, like I'm going to be the one that they're going to blame for it. ; Therapist: So just to make sure I understand, your report, so they were engaging these behaviors and your report is what precipitated them being broken up? ; Patient: Yeah, because, you know, before that, I guess, you know, probably nobody else would have known about it. ; Patient: So I made the report about what was going on and I think, yeah, as a direct result. ; Therapist: All right, let's take a look at the evidence, right? ; Therapist: So in CBT, we like to evaluate evidence and try to look at the facts as we understand them. ; Therapist: Really we want to scrutinize and carefully review the facts and evidence and hold a light to it and try to figure out what's going on. ; Therapist: What would have happened with this family if you hadn't or if no one intervened? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, it wasn't going great for the kids. ; Patient: It wasn't really a great environment, but I just feel like if I had left it alone, I don't know that the kids would be with their parents. ; Therapist: So they'd all be together. ; Therapist: And you feel like right now, you think with them being apart, that's not as good as if they were together. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I guess I feel like it probably wasn't great for them to be there. ; Patient: I mean, that's why I made the report. ; Patient: That's my job. ; Patient: But it just feels like, you know, I just feels like I'm playing God. ; Patient: You know what I mean? ; Patient: Like that I'm just coming in here and spend like five, 10 minutes with a family and then to turn their whole world upside down. ; Therapist: You have a tremendous amount of power. ; Therapist: And if you misuse that power, you could devastate families. ; Therapist: That's maybe what you think happened here. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So going back to what would have happened to them, let me just step back there for a moment. ; Therapist: They would still be together without your intervention. ; Therapist: And that could be a positive. ; Therapist: What about consequences that may be more negative? ; Patient: Well, I mean, like I said, I thought they were using drugs in the home. ; Patient: So that's like a really dangerous situation for kids to be in because you don't know what kind of people are coming in and out of the home, if the parents are going to be, you know, coherent enough to help them if there's an emergency or if the parents are even making them food and taking care of their needs and stuff like that. ; Patient: So I guess in that sense, that's really concerning. ; Patient: And that's a big part of the reason why I made the report. ; Therapist: So you made the report because it's your responsibility, but also you had concerns about their welfare. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: If you could go back and do it again, would you change anything? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I guess that's just the hardest part for me is like, I feel like I can't make the right decision. ; Patient: I just feel like I don't know if I'm equipped to be the person to make that kind of decision. ; Therapist: So you don't know if you made a good decision or not, and further, you question your ability going forward to make decisions. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Therapist: And that's the uncertainty, the anxiety.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Alex, my name is Tony, I'll be your nurse for today. ; Therapist: How are you doing? ; Patient: I'm okay I guess, just waiting for the stitches to come out, it would be nice. ; Therapist: Oh, what happened? ; Patient: Got into a bar fight. ; Therapist: Can you tell me a little bit more about this bar fight? ; Patient: Okay, story time, you ready for this? ; Patient: So, we're out with my girls, having a fantastic time, looking all on fleek and ish. ; Patient: And then this girl, like she has the nerve to stare at me from across the room, it gives me this kind of like this. ; Patient: And then she comes up to me, she bumps into me, she spills my drink, and she comes up and then she's like, I slept with your man. ; Patient: So I'm like, excuse me? ; Patient: So obviously I pushed her, she pushed me kind of thing, and yeah, one thing led to another. ; Patient: I'm here, it's a blur from that point on, but all I know is that cops showed up, I'm here, and I have this to deal with. ; Patient: Fantastic, right? ; Therapist: Well, from what I'm getting here, you were intoxicated at that point in time, and then you had a confrontation with this girl, which led to the bar fight. ; Therapist: Am I missing anything? ; Patient: Oh god, I was more than intoxicated, I was smashed! ; Patient: You should have seen it. ; Patient: But like, this type of thing doesn't happen often, so I don't want you to be sitting here and referring me to some AA, because yo, I'm not an alcoholic. ; Therapist: Okay, so it seems like you get offended, you feel offended being referred to an AA. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm not an alcoholic, no. ; Therapist: Okay, because it labels you as an alcoholic. ; Patient: Yeah, exactly. ; Therapist: Alright, well we do have some time right now, if it's okay with you, I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about your drinking habits? ; Patient: Yeah, sure, what do you want to know? ; Therapist: Well, to you, what is drinking different for you? ; Patient: Well, you know, being 25, that's what we do. ; Patient: We get together, we hang out, we get a couple of drinks, it's me and my girls, we do this all the time, and I love this. ; Patient: It breaks the ice when we go socializing, so meet new people kind of thing, you know, grow a friend circle, it's fantastic. ; Patient: And it definitely relaxes me after a stressful week, and my weeks are so stressful, I need this, you know. ; Patient: So, I mean, yeah, but just so you know, I do drink responsibly and I never drink and drive and I don't intend on doing that. ; Therapist: Okay, so to me, it seems that drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends, it's your way to socialize, and it breaks that ice, right, it helps you socialize. ; Therapist: I also want to say that it's very responsible of you to be drinking and not driving. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: How has it affected your life? ; Patient: Oh, has it? ; Patient: Well, I mean, now that this happens, I do have it because of that bar fight, and oh, my kid's going to kill me, oh my God. ; Patient: He's going to be disappointed. ; Patient: So I guess you could say that my relationship with Henry, it's been great, fantastic, but he says that when I drink, it's like I'm not myself, it's like somebody he's never met before. ; Patient: And obviously you can imagine the arguments, the fights, and oh, my God, all that stress. ; Patient: It's just, I love him so much, but you know, but it's a stress, and it's like I don't know if we're going to make it. ; Therapist: I see. ; Patient: It's just, oh, my God. ; Therapist: So from my understanding, drinking, it helps you socialize with friends, it relaxes you, it's your way of just, you know, it breaks that ice for you. ; Therapist: But on the other hand, it's causing a lot of arguments with you and your significant other, Henry, and it's causing a lot that all those arguments are leading to a lot of stress in your relationship this point in time. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, we're engaged, and look how pretty this is. ; Patient: I don't want to lose that. ; Patient: Like, you put it that way, I mean, I'm worried because what's he going to think of me later on in life? ; Patient: What's he going to tell our children? ; Patient: Oh, your mom's an alcoholic? ; Patient: She drank this and they got him to fight? ; Patient: I don't want anyone to ever think of me that way. ; Patient: But at the same time, I mean, I don't want to quit cold turkey. ; Patient: I mean, you must understand how hard this is for me to even be here and talk about it. ; Patient: But I love him so much. ; Patient: I mean, I would do anything for him. ; Patient: And he's going to be so disappointed in me. ; Patient: He hasn't even seen me, oh, my God. ; Patient: I don't know how can I face him. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: He seems like a very lucky guy to have someone love him that much. ; Patient: I mean, boy, seriously, he's not going to find anybody that loves him as much as I do. ; Patient: Trust me on that. ; Patient: Not going to happen. ; Therapist: So what I'm getting here right now is that you do want to quit. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And it's just partly because this alcohol is leading to the arguments with Henry and it's causing that stress to your relationship. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I know we spoke about AA earlier and I know you don't really like the idea of it. ; Therapist: But what do you know about AA? ; Therapist: Like what's your, you want to shed some light on that? ; Patient: It's a place where alcoholics go to discuss their problems. ; Patient: And like I said, I'm not an alcoholic. ; Therapist: Well, you're right. ; Therapist: They're from multiple flocks of life and they share their drinking stories. ; Therapist: And everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I know you don't want to join AA at this point in time perhaps. ; Therapist: But hypothetically speaking, would you ever consider joining AA maybe later on down the road? ; Patient: If this is what I have to do to get my guy back, then I'll do it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, on a scale of one to ten, ten being like for sure and one being not really sure about it at all, what would you say where you are on the scale with joining AA? ; Patient: Well, you put it that way. ; Patient: Everything I told you, I would say a six. ; Therapist: A six? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Why would you say a six instead of say a three? ; Therapist: I mean, you're really adamant about not joining AA earlier. ; Patient: Well, it's all about Henry. ; Patient: At the end of the day, it matters to me if I want to keep this engagement. ; Patient: And I will do anything for that man. ; Patient: So of course, if this is what I have to do, then I have to do. ; Patient: This is him, let me tell you. ; Patient: His relationship with me and I with him is so much more important to me than drunken nights at a bar. ; Therapist: You're a lucky man, like I said. ; Patient: I'll tell him that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So right now we're sitting at a six. ; Therapist: What needs to happen to say maybe we can jump that to an eight or a nine? ; Patient: You know, like flexible hours maybe, if that is even an option. ; Patient: Also, maybe if there's a place nearby somewhere, like nearby my house, that would be great. ; Patient: So I don't have to waste gas because it's expensive. ; Patient: I already go to work and it's far anyway. ; Patient: And I guess it has to do with attitude as well. ; Patient: I don't want to sit there in a circle like this and somebody judging me because the way I look and my drinking habits and all of that. ; Patient: So I guess I'm just looking for a good vibe. ; Patient: I don't want to be judged or labeled. ; Therapist: All of these are very understandable. ; Therapist: I mean, it's just, of course you want some meeting to be close to you so you don't have to commute so far. ; Therapist: We all have very busy schedules. ; Therapist: That's something that fits within our busy schedule. ; Therapist: It definitely makes sense. ; Therapist: And of course the environment. ; Therapist: I mean, if you're not happy, they're just an even and learning environment. ; Therapist: If you're not comfortable there, then it's very hard for you to be in that environment. ; Patient: Yeah, exactly. ; Therapist: Well, actually today, I was wondering if it's okay with you. ; Therapist: I can give you this for sure. ; Therapist: It's just for an AA meeting, you're really close to your location where you live. ; Therapist: And my number is also on there. ; Therapist: You can always give me a call if you have any concerns. ; Therapist: And also, I just want to thank you today for sharing with me your experience with drinking. ; Therapist: And I know it's not easy to just... ; Patient: No, it's not. ; Therapist: This is a very sensitive subject. ; Therapist: So I want to thank you. ; Patient: Thank you for listening to me. ; Patient: No one has actually sat down and talked to me about anything. ; Patient: I feel like you shed some light on an issue. ; Patient: So thank you. ; Therapist: You're very welcome. ; Therapist: It really means a lot. ; Therapist: You're very welcome. ; Therapist: And if it's okay with you, perhaps maybe we can schedule another follow-up meeting. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Say about two weeks or so. ; Patient: Yeah, that sounds fine. ; Patient: Yeah, that's okay. ; Patient: I think two weeks work. ; Patient: We'll go on from there. ; Patient: Two weeks. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, I'll see you then. ; Patient: I'll see you then.",

; Patient: Well, I was in a car accident about a month and a half ago. ; Patient: And I've just been having these issues that are preventing me from doing the things I'm used to doing. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about the accident? ; Patient: Well, I was on my way home from work and I was sitting at a stop sign and waiting for my term to go. ; Patient: And as I proceeded through the stop sign, a car just came and blew through and hit me on the side and pushed me straight through the stop sign. ; Therapist: Were you hurt? ; Patient: Not too bad, no. ; Therapist: Not too bad? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Scary though, huh? ; Patient: It was very scary. ; Therapist: And when was this? ; Patient: This was about a month and I guess maybe two months ago. ; Therapist: About two months ago? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And when did the symptoms start? ; Patient: Shortly after. ; Patient: I've been feeling pretty bad for about a month or so. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about those feelings? ; Patient: I've had a lot of anxiety, especially when it comes to getting in my car and going places. ; Patient: I just get really overwhelmed with fear. ; Patient: Just scared that I'm going to get into another car accident. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You are still driving? ; Patient: Not a lot. ; Therapist: Not a lot? ; Patient: Not a lot, no. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You're not driving a lot, but you are able to drive. ; Therapist: But when you do drive, there's a lot of anxiety. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: There's a lot of fear. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Are you more aware of what's going on around you? ; Patient: Definitely. ; Patient: I think I'm, I would say, over aware. ; Patient: I can't, sometimes I can't even focus on where I'm going because I'm just paying attention to all the drivers on the road. ; Patient: Just, you know, making sure that I don't get hit again. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you're driving with more awareness of what's going on around you? ; Therapist: Anxious? ; Therapist: Any irritability? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: A lot more than usual. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about that? ; Patient: Well, I have two dogs and I love my dogs. ; Patient: And just lately, everything they do just gets on my nerves. ; Patient: You know, just barking, walking. ; Patient: I mean, everything just, and I don't know where that's coming from. ; Patient: I've never been like that with them before, but they just, they bother me so much that I don't even want them around sometimes. ; Therapist: Have you, since the accent, or since the symptoms started, have you had positive feelings like happiness, joy? ; Patient: No, everything just depresses me anymore. ; Therapist: Everything. ; Patient: Nothing seems to be going right at all. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Not since the symptoms started. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you know how when something surprises you and you're startled, right, that's natural for everybody, have you noticed that that startle response is different now after the accent? ; Patient: It is. ; Patient: Everything startles me. ; Patient: Just, you know, a knock at the door or the phone ringing or anything just, yeah, just kind of scares me out of my skin. ; Therapist: So that's more so than it would have in the past? ; Patient: Yeah, I've never been like that before. ; Therapist: Any changes in your concentration? ; Patient: I can't seem to focus on anything. ; Patient: I'm in school and when I have readings to do for school, I just, I get so distracted. ; Patient: I have to close the book and do something else. ; Patient: I can't, yeah, I definitely can't focus when it comes to my schoolwork. ; Therapist: So when you're having trouble concentrating, what kind of thoughts are you being distracted toward? ; Patient: If I have somewhere to go, I'm thinking about, you know, getting in the car and driving and, you know, the possibility of being in another accident. ; Patient: I just, a lot of my thoughts seem to focus on being in my car and just the accident. ; Patient: I can't seem to shake that. ; Therapist: So you've tried to kind of push the thoughts aside and then they're still there? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any trouble sleeping? ; Patient: Somewhat. ; Patient: I don't have any trouble getting to sleep, but I have trouble staying to sleep. ; Therapist: So you wake up several times? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: At night? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about your relationship with other people? ; Therapist: Do you feel there's the same distance or do you feel closer or more detached? ; Patient: Well, my mom is probably the person I'm closest to and I haven't really wanted to spend a lot of time with her anymore. ; Patient: I'm really just staying in the house and just staying to myself. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about dreams? ; Therapist: Any change in dreams, like the events of the accident come up? ; Patient: Well, one night there was this dream that stuck out to me. ; Patient: I was driving home from work and I was just about to get on the highway and I heard sirens coming. ; Patient: And I stopped to see where the sirens were going and they got closer and closer to me and they seemed to surround me. ; Patient: And I was like, wait, what's going on? ; Patient: And I woke up and I was like, oh my gosh, I felt like I was right back there in that moment where I was in a car accident and the police responded to the accident. ; Patient: But it was so much more intensified. ; Patient: I've never had a dream like that before. ; Patient: And when you woke up, it sounds like you were alarmed and distressed. ; Patient: I was. ; Patient: I was. ; Therapist: Has that ever happened when you weren't asleep instead of like a dream? ; Therapist: Have you ever had a moment where you're kind of back in the car accident? ; Therapist: You know, in the car as the accident is happening, like it feels like you're really back there? ; Patient: Maybe once or twice, but not really, no. ; Therapist: Not sure? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Do you have any medical problems? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing coming on? ; Therapist: Any use of drugs or alcohol? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do you remember all the details of the accident or do you feel like there's pieces of that memory that are missing? ; Patient: I really can't remember the details. ; Patient: I just know I got hit. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I can't remember back to what happened and people keep asking me and I just, I can't remember at all really what happened. ; Therapist: Alright, so there's some memory loss surrounding that? ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Therapist: Do you ever have, or since the symptoms have come on, do you ever feel like you're not really yourself, you're separated from yourself, kind of an unreal experience, or you're separated from the world? ; Therapist: Either one of those? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright, Jessica, based on our conversation here, I'm going to set you up to see a counselor if that's something you're open to. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And I want to thank you for taking the time to tell me what happened and answer my questions. ; Therapist: It's been very helpful. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Patient: Come in. ; Therapist: Hi, Ms. ; Therapist: Alexander. ; Patient: Hi. ; Therapist: Hi, my name is Brittany and I'm a medical student working with Dr. Parrott today. ; Therapist: I'll try to get this all rubbed in. ; Therapist: It's nice to meet you. ; Patient: Nice to meet you. ; Therapist: So she has sent me in just to ask you some questions and do a brief physical exam, and then I will step back out and talk to her, and then she'll be in behind me. ; Therapist: Is that okay? ; Patient: Yeah, that's fine. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So what brings you in today? ; Patient: I've been having pretty bad neck pain. ; Therapist: Oh, goodness. ; Therapist: Well, I'm glad you came in so we can take a look and make sure there's nothing going on. ; Therapist: So how long has this been going on? ; Patient: Probably about two days. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Did anything happen a couple days ago out of the ordinary? ; Patient: Well, I was in a small car accident. ; Therapist: Oh, okay. ; Therapist: Must have been scary. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What happened? ; Patient: I was at a stoplight and the person behind me rear-ended me. ; Patient: We weren't going very fast, though. ; Patient: I think he was maybe going five or ten miles an hour. ; Therapist: And were you wearing your seat belt at the time? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you said you didn't go to the hospital or anything because you didn't feel any pain initially. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: So when exactly did the pain start? ; Therapist: About how many hours after the accident? ; Patient: I would probably say maybe four to six hours after. ; Patient: I think maybe I was just in shock at first and so I didn't really feel any pain or anything. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And where is it bothering you specifically? ; Therapist: Can you pinpoint a specific area on your neck? ; Patient: It's mostly just the back of my neck and on the sides of my neck. ; Therapist: Both sides? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And did you hear any pops or have any numbness or tingling that occurred during the accident? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Mm-mm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And is there anything that's making the pain worse? ; Patient: Mostly when I bend my head forward and try to turn it to the left, it kind of- ; Therapist: I notice it's a little uncomfortable. ; Patient: It's really tight. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Anything you've ever felt before? ; Patient: I took some ibuprofen and I put ice on the back of my neck and that helped a little bit, but it still hurts. ; Therapist: It still hurts. ; Therapist: Mm-mm. ; Therapist: And how much ibuprofen are you taking? ; Patient: I took two tablets every six hours or so since then. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm just taking some notes so that way we can get the pain back. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So it's worse whenever you're bending forward and to the side, to the left. ; Therapist: Is that correct? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And can you describe the pain to me? ; Patient: It just feels like a tight kind of dull pain. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So tight and dull. ; Therapist: And is this pain radiating or moving anywhere? ; Patient: Not really. ; Patient: It just goes up and down the back of my neck. ; Therapist: So nothing coming down into the arms? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain, where would you say you're at? ; Patient: Probably around a six or a seven out of ten, especially when I try and bend forward and turn my head. ; Therapist: And is it a constant pain? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And so, but it'll get worse whenever you bend forward and turn to the left. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And would you say since the accident, since that evening, has it been constant or is it getting worse, better? ; Therapist: What would you say? ; Patient: It feels like it's getting worse, but I don't know if that's because the ibuprofen's not working. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, I'm glad you came in. ; Therapist: You know, the over-the-counter stuff's not working, and we can do an exam and make sure there's nothing we're missing. ; Therapist: You know, if we need to possibly do some osteopathic treatments, and we'll get on to that later, okay? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And as far as your past medical history, have you ever had a neck injury before? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: So you've never had problems with your neck? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, that's good to know. ; Therapist: And any medical conditions that you're currently being treated for or that you've ever been treated for? ; Patient: I have asthma, and I take medicine for that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: So that's about it. ; Therapist: Ever been hospitalized? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Mm-mm. ; Therapist: Ever had any surgeries? ; Patient: I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid. ; Patient: I think I was probably nine. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And as far as medications, you said you take the over-the-counter ibuprofen, and then you take something for asthma. ; Therapist: What do you take for your asthma? ; Patient: I take albuterol. ; Therapist: Do you just take that as needed? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And do you take any other medications? ; Patient: I take a loratadine or a Claritin for allergies. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What about any herbal supplements, vitamins? ; Patient: I take a multivitamin. ; Therapist: And I always like to ask all my patients, any recreational drug use? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: None. ; Therapist: And are you allergic to any medications? ; Patient: I am. ; Patient: I'm allergic to penicillin. ; Therapist: And what happens when you take penicillin? ; Patient: I break out in a rash. ; Therapist: In a rash. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Well, we'd be sure never to give you penicillin for anything. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: And as far as family history, any medical conditions in the family with your mom and dad? ; Patient: My mom, she's pretty healthy. ; Patient: She has diabetes, though. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And it's pretty under control. ; Therapist: Good. ; Patient: My dad has high cholesterol, but he takes medicine for that. ; Therapist: Any brothers or sisters? ; Patient: I have a brother, and he's healthy. ; Therapist: He's healthy? ; Patient: He doesn't have any conditions or anything. ; Therapist: And no one's ever had problems with joints or arthritis? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: And I always like to just get an overview of my patients, kind of get to know them a little better. ; Therapist: What do you do for a living? ; Patient: I'm an administrative assistant. ; Therapist: Oh, where do you work? ; Patient: I work for the Fish and Wildlife Services. ; Therapist: Oh, wow. ; Therapist: That must be fun. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You've been doing it for a while? ; Patient: Yeah, for a few years. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Stressful or pretty? ; Patient: It's not very stressful at all. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And are you married? ; Patient: I am. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Congratulations. ; Patient: Thanks. ; Therapist: Do you have any children? ; Patient: No, not yet. ; Therapist: No children? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And so do you have hobbies that you like to do? ; Patient: I do. ; Patient: I like to cook, and I like to garden. ; Patient: It's been kind of difficult to garden because I can't lean forward as much for the past ; Patient: two days. ; Therapist: Yeah, it can be frustrating when you can't do the things you enjoy. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any tobacco use? ; Patient: I smoke probably maybe half a pack a day, if that. ; Therapist: And how long have you been smoking? ; Patient: Oh, I want to say maybe seven years or so. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Any alcohol use? ; Patient: Occasional. ; Patient: I'll have a glass of wine with dinner maybe once a week. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, I believe I got all the information I needed from you, so we're going to go ahead and move on to the physical exam portion. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to have you take a seat up here. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: For the physical exam, I'm going to go ahead and listen to your heart and lungs and make sure those sound nice and clear. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So I'm just going to slide this down and just breathe normal. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And go and take a big deep breath. ; Therapist: And again. ; Therapist: Again. ; Therapist: And last one. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: And so I'm just going to do a structural exam here and palpate down your spine. ; Therapist: Let me know if there's anything that's tender. ; Patient: It's tender everywhere. ; Therapist: Everywhere. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm going to work my way down. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And I'm going to check the range of motion in your neck. ; Therapist: So what I want you to do is try to put your chin down to your chest. ; Patient: It's about as far as I can go. ; Therapist: And then looking up to the ceiling, pretty stiff. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what about looking, turning and looking over to this shoulder? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And turn and look to that shoulder for me. ; Therapist: Right there. ; Patient: Right there. ; Therapist: And then ear to your shoulder. ; Therapist: Trying to touch your ear over to your shoulder. ; Therapist: And then ear to the other shoulder. ; Patient: That's as far as I can go on this side. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And I'm going to go ahead and check just some reflexes. ; Therapist: This will kind of tell me if there's any nerves that are involved. ; Therapist: So just relax your arm. ; Therapist: And we're going to rest your arm right here on your lap. ; Therapist: And just relax. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And I'm going to do the same thing on this arm. ; Therapist: So just relax your arm. ; Therapist: And just relax. ; Therapist: And then the last one, just let your arm hang. ; Therapist: And now I'm going to test and see how strong you are. ; Therapist: So place your arms like this for me and don't let me move your arms. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: And arms up. ; Therapist: And don't let me push them. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: And fingers out for me. ; Therapist: Don't let me squeeze them. ; Therapist: And fingers together and try to push them out. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: If it's okay with you, as an osteopathic student we've learned some treatments. ; Therapist: So I'm going to do some soft tissue to try and break up some of this tension that you're having. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: If that sounds okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm going to hurt yourself. ; Patient: It doesn't want to hurt too bad. ; Therapist: No, it's not going to hurt. ; Therapist: And if there's any pain, I want you to let me know. ; Therapist: And so I'm just going to do just very gentle, it's called myofascial. ; Therapist: I'm just going to slowly up. ; Therapist: And if this is something that you do get some relief from after this evening, then you can come back and we can be a little more aggressive. ; Therapist: But since the car accident was just two days ago, I want to be very gentle. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm just going to hold this right here. ; Therapist: All those muscles that are tight and spasming right now attach right up where my fingers are at. ; Therapist: So I'm just trying to get them to relax and loosen. ; Patient: So this is supposed to relax all the muscles in here? ; Therapist: Uh-huh. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: I think that will be enough for today. ; Therapist: I don't want to do too much since it was such an acute injury. ; Therapist: So I'm going to go ahead and help you up. ; Therapist: And then I'm going to go ahead and summarize everything that you told me from earlier, if that's okay. ; Therapist: Would you prefer sitting back down in the chair? ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: I'll help you here. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So you started having some neck pain two days ago after a motor vehicle accident. ; Therapist: You were rear-ended, but you were wearing your seat belt. ; Therapist: You didn't hear any pop or have any numbness or tingling that occurred. ; Therapist: And it's just been real tight for the past two days, real constant, but it's worse whenever you flex your head down or turn to the left. ; Therapist: Is that correct? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And as far as your past medical history, you just have asthma and you're taking some medication for that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And you're not allergic to anything? ; Patient: Penicillin. ; Therapist: Oh, excuse me. ; Therapist: Yes, that's right. ; Therapist: You are allergic to penicillin. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: What I will do is I will go talk to Dr. Parrott, and then we will be back in to put together a treatment option plan for you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Any other questions or concerns you have for me today? ; Patient: No, I don't think so. ; Patient: I just want to feel better. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: Well, that is our main goal, so I'm glad you came in today. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Patient: Thank you.",

; Therapist: Is it because of the anxiety? ; Patient: Yeah, well I'm scared that something's going to happen at my apartment so I need to unplug things. ; Patient: But it has to be in order. ; Patient: So when I unplug things it has to start with the TV and then my computer and then my phone and the lamps and then I've been late to work. ; Therapist: Alright, so you have a system you go through of unplugging different objects in your apartment and you're worried that they're going to cause a problem if they're left plugged in? ; Patient: Yeah, like if they overheat it could like burn it down. ; Therapist: So you're afraid that if you leave them plugged in they'll overheat? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And your apartment will catch on fire? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And you have a particular order you go in as you unplug? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What happens if you're unplugging the items and you get distracted or something interrupts that? ; Patient: Well, I mean sometimes I'll get like a text message and I'll hear my phone go off. ; Patient: I'll have to just start all over again. ; Therapist: Will you plug the objects back in or will you, how will you do it for the items that are already unplugged? ; Patient: I would just have to unplug them and then I would have to plug them back in or vice versa. ; Therapist: So you go back and plug them in? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And unplug them. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: What's your anxiety level like as you start that process? ; Patient: It's really bad. ; Therapist: Is it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about toward the end of the process? ; Patient: It goes away but it's just kind of temporary just for a little bit of time and then it comes back and I have to go check it again. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So when it comes back, everything's unplugged. ; Therapist: So you have to plug everything back in and unplug it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And go through the whole process again? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So it's pretty distressing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you think that this is what led to the problems of employment? ; Patient: Yeah, because I also, I have to lock my door but I like to lock it 12 times. ; Patient: So I'll put the key in and I'll hear it click but then I just like doing it 12 times just to make sure it's locked and that made me late for work. ; Patient: And then when I was at work, I have a drawer on my cashier so I would just make sure it was locked but I would have to do it 12 times just to make sure it was locked and I didn't get back in time to help the customers. ; Therapist: Alright, so your employer wasn't happy with that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that led to you losing your job? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Are you working now? ; Patient: No, I had a job for a little bit of time. ; Patient: It was again a cashier position but I was on break and I was like in the room and I had the lights and I just wanted to make sure they would go off all the way because I didn't want to leave the light on. ; Patient: And by the time I got done turning them on and just making sure they were off, I didn't get back in time on the floor and my employer just said I wasn't a good fit. ; Therapist: Wasn't a good fit. ; Therapist: Alright, so these symptoms have caused you some real problems with employment and how about with your anxiety level? ; Patient: My anxiety is really bad. ; Therapist: If we were to put on a scale where one was very little anxiety and ten was the worst anxiety you've ever experienced, what kind of anxiety are you having on a daily basis now? ; Patient: Probably like a ten. ; Therapist: A ten, so the worst ever. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And checking doors, checking light switches, unplugging everything, this reduces your anxiety for a while? ; Patient: Just for a little bit. ; Therapist: But then it comes back. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Is there anything else that you do that helps to reduce the anxiety? ; Patient: It's just I guess when I'm in the act of doing it, it will relieve it and then I'll be okay for a little bit of time. ; Patient: Like even coming in, you know, I have like, I have somebody had chairs and some pitchers and I just like I had to touch them, like I had to touch the chairs, but I wanted to touch the chairs first and then the pitchers and that's normally what I do in a room. ; Patient: Like I have to touch the chairs first and I feel okay when I'm doing it and then when I'm finished I feel a little better but then it comes back. ; Patient: The anxiety. ; Therapist: Do you know how long you've had these symptoms? ; Patient: Probably since I guess like third grade maybe. ; Therapist: So sometime. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Did they start off like they are now or were they different? ; Patient: It started off with a little bit of things, like I would just get a little bit of anxiety and I just would want to play with the doorknob and then as I got, it went away for like a year maybe and then I would start to play with the lights and just make sure that they were off. ; Therapist: It was the same thing that helped reduce anxiety? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Did it cause you any trouble? ; Patient: My parents didn't really like it. ; Patient: They kind of were like, you know, something's wrong with you. ; Patient: You know, stop playing with that. ; Therapist: Were you ever taken somewhere and diagnosed or treated? ; Patient: No, no. ; Patient: My parents just thought it was like nerves. ; Therapist: And now it's the worst it's ever been? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you feel like you're able to go back to work with the symptoms the way they are now? ; Patient: Probably not. ; Therapist: Because they're so disruptive? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you ever had any medical conditions? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: And have you ever used or do you use any type of drug or alcohol? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: None? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Emma, I want to thank you for coming in. ; Therapist: I'm going to get you scheduled to see one of our counselors. ; Therapist: I appreciate you spending this time with me. ; Therapist: It's helped me to understand what you're going through. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

; Patient: Usually I didn't get along with the teachers honestly. ; Patient: I was always a class clown so I'm usually getting kicked out. ; Patient: I was always getting detention so I didn't really get along with the teachers. ; Patient: I would try and ditch class and stuff. ; Therapist: So overall today are you pursuing or do you want to further your education? ; Patient: Yeah I'm trying to get into college actually. ; Therapist: So you're looking into maybe like a four year old junior college. ; Therapist: Yeah a junior college for right now actually. ; Therapist: What would be like, give me a little bit, during the time that you were in school did you have a job? ; Therapist: Have you worked? ; Patient: I did. ; Patient: I was working at Paul's Place. ; Patient: It's a restaurant through the school. ; Patient: And it was like a job program. ; Patient: Packaging knives and forks and napkins, salt and pepper and would send them over to the restaurant. ; Therapist: You would send them over to the restaurant? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you would prep everything, all the utensils, get ready. ; Therapist: Now when you were working, how did that make you feel when you were working? ; Patient: I liked it. ; Patient: It got boring at times honestly. ; Patient: And because the paychecks were also really small. ; Therapist: But it was a start. ; Patient: Yeah it was a start. ; Therapist: And so how did it make you feel good? ; Therapist: Because you worked for something and then the finished product was your paycheck. ; Therapist: Yeah that's what you get. ; Therapist: So if you want something in life you pretty much have to work for it. ; Therapist: Work for it. ; Therapist: Work hard. ; Therapist: It's going to teach you how to work at a young age. ; Therapist: How old were you when you started working? ; Therapist: I was 15. ; Therapist: You were 15 years old and then you started working and it was a program for the school. ; Therapist: So you know at a young age that it's going to take hard work. ; Therapist: Yeah to achieve something. ; Therapist: To achieve something. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Now what about your dream job? ; Therapist: What would be if tomorrow you could say I'm this person tomorrow or this is my profession tomorrow. ; Therapist: What would be your dream job? ; Therapist: A pilot. ; Therapist: A pilot. ; Therapist: Oh a pilot wow. ; Therapist: And what was your reasoning behind that? ; Therapist: I love airplanes. ; Therapist: I used to make model airplanes. ; Therapist: That's right you mentioned that you made model planes. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Tell me more about that. ; Therapist: What would you do in your dream job? ; Therapist: I just want to fly. ; Therapist: Fly. ; Therapist: I like being in the air. ; Patient: I like going fast. ; Patient: Going fast. ; Patient: Going to the air. ; Patient: Going fast. ; Patient: Going fast. ; Patient: Going fast. ; Patient: Going fast. ; Therapist: Going fast. ; Therapist: Going fast. ; Therapist: Being in the air. ; Therapist: Being above. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Above things. ; Therapist: Being able to see from a different view. ; Therapist: And so a pilot. ; Therapist: Have you looked into what it would take to become a pilot? ; Patient: You know what the only star goal with that is math. ; Patient: So I don't think it's going to work out. ; Patient: What would be your next dream job? ; Therapist: A cop. ; Therapist: A cop. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: A police officer. ; Patient: Have you looked into that? ; Patient: Yeah I'm trying to get back into this cadet program I was doing for about around three weeks ago. ; Patient: I was doing it but it was too far so I had to kind of let it go. ; Patient: And I'm trying to look for one in my area. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And maybe that's something we can discuss to help you find a cadet program close by. ; Therapist: And then we're able to give you some goals to set and get you in a program like that. ; Therapist: But let's look at, let's back up a little bit to the marijuana. ; Therapist: Because you and I know being in law enforcement, you know, marijuana and being a cop, pretty much you would have to. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you would have to, what would you have to do? ; Therapist: Let it go. ; Therapist: You would have to let it go. ; Therapist: So what we want to do while you're here, we want to help you here develop a treatment plan, a treatment model where you can pursue some realistic goals. ; Therapist: We want to set some goals for you. ; Therapist: Also what about your medical history? ; Therapist: Tell me a little bit about your medical history. ; Therapist: Have you ever been in the hospital? ; Therapist: Has anything ever happened to you? ; Therapist: You've broken a bone? ; Patient: I've had surgery on my arm because I was in a motorcycle racing. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I fell. ; Patient: And I had to get it all stitched up. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: And then you cut your shelf on what? ; Therapist: It was a piece of metal that was scripted. ; Therapist: Scripted on. ; Therapist: So you got stitches. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you're doing better. ; Therapist: What about in your family is there any diseases that might in your family anyone suffer from any illnesses, ailments? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And as far as medical attention, is there anyone that needed medical attention in the past? ; Therapist: Maybe someone on meds, in your family, psychological, health. ; Patient: Can you explain a little bit? ; Therapist: Is there anyone maybe that has gone to therapy, that has been in therapy in your family, a ; Patient: family member? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what we want to do, what I want to do to help you with this Curtis is one, we want to develop a treatment plan to help you with the marijuana use. ; Therapist: We want to be able to look at your support system. ; Therapist: You know, who's in your life right now? ; Therapist: What are your, the friends that you smoke marijuana with? ; Therapist: What type of people are they? ; Therapist: Would this be, is this a good fit for you? ; Therapist: But our whole goal is to start you off with small steps. ; Therapist: So today you're using marijuana how many times a day? ; Therapist: So you pretty much said you're using it every day. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I believe you said every day. ; Patient: But how many times a day? ; Therapist: Yeah, how many times a day for a month. ; Therapist: Yeah, so. ; Therapist: Do you wake up and you do it? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: It's not like my morning routine, you go ahead and do it. ; Patient: And then usually around noon time I do it again and then towards five o'clock I do it again, then at nighttime, five other days I'll do it again. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So one of, maybe one of the realistic goals is you're okay, you know, we can narrow down maybe the relationship. ; Therapist: Which of your friends right now today, how many of them smoke marijuana? ; Patient: About six, seven. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Maybe a realistic short term goal is to begin to see which friends. ; Therapist: To hang out with? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's what my mom told me. ; Therapist: And then also your mom makes it. ; Therapist: What did she tell you? ; Patient: She told me before you fall into the wrong crowd and you fall into something, just she pretty much said that if I keep this up it's going to get me into something I don't want to get into. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: You know, jail time. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: You know, because we make you do things that you shouldn't be doing. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: And other things legal. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So definitely we want to look at your whole peer relationships, who your friends are. ; Therapist: We also want to look at your time right now. ; Therapist: So you mentioned earlier that you were working. ; Therapist: Are you working today? ; Patient: No, I'm not. ; Therapist: Okay, so maybe that's another thing, a realistic goal that we need to look at and maybe help you pursue is a job. ; Therapist: Maybe because the idle time sometimes can trigger events, you know, where you begin to want to use marijuana. ; Therapist: And then we can identify some of the emotions that you're feeling. ; Therapist: Let's go over that maybe briefly. ; Therapist: Before you get, before you smoke marijuana, is there a feeling that you have that says, hey, I'm a little depressed. ; Therapist: Depressed. ; Therapist: So we can look at the depression and see how we can treat that. ; Therapist: What else, what are some of the other feelings that you see? ; Therapist: Sad, angry, you know. ; Therapist: What were you angry about? ; Therapist: There might be asking for this. ; Patient: I would actually like to be up in the morning with my girlfriend. ; Patient: So it's kind of a stress still. ; Patient: It still bothers me as much as I'm trying to ignore it. ; Patient: It still bothers me. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Are there certain days that maybe perhaps you remember? ; Therapist: Is there events? ; Patient: Like Thanksgiving and Christmas and holidays and things like that. ; Patient: That's when you become angry towards how you were brought up. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean it's not that I don't appreciate my foster parents because I do. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: But I just really have been born with my biological family. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: But I've been a lot better. ; Therapist: So we want to maybe equip you with some coping skills. ; Therapist: How to cope with those things. ; Therapist: How to prepare you maybe for the holidays. ; Therapist: Maybe there's a way we can begin to look at that during the holidays. ; Therapist: These are the emotions I feel. ; Therapist: So we identify those emotions and we'll be able to take care of that. ; Therapist: We'll be able to prepare you prior to you falling back into the trap and going out and using marijuana. ; Therapist: Maybe during Christmas. ; Therapist: Do you feel the same way during Christmas? ; Therapist: I do. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Maybe even your birthday, father's day, mother's day. ; Therapist: These are all the things that we can kind of get you ready for. ; Therapist: Because once again it's going to take small steps. ; Therapist: Realistic goals. ; Therapist: And then what we want to do after that, the realistic goals is just get you ready for long term goals. ; Therapist: But Curtis, I'm glad you came into my office. ; Therapist: It was great meeting you. ; Therapist: I look forward to working with you. ; Therapist: Is there any other questions that you may have for me? ; Therapist: Is there anything that I can do at all? ; Patient: I do. ; Patient: I just kind of run a whole lot of times a week and I'm going to be allowed to come in ; Therapist: to therapy. ; Therapist: Well what we can do, we'll set you up with a treatment plan and then I'd like to at least have two contacts with you a week. ; Therapist: And we can go over that. ; Therapist: And then maybe during one of the contacts we can help you with a job. ; Therapist: And then identifying some of the emotions. ; Therapist: And then maybe we can get the whole marijuana use, we can begin to kind of taper it down. ; Therapist: Instead of every day, we'll begin to see how we can taper that down. ; Therapist: But again, I'm glad that you came. ; Therapist: It was a pleasure meeting you and we'll be in touch and we'll be able to do this again. ; Therapist: Alright Curtis, good seeing you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Good afternoon Lily, I'm glad you could make it in today. ; Patient: I'm glad I came in. ; Therapist: How has your week been so far? ; Patient: I'm still a little bit anxious. ; Therapist: Yes, last week when you were in you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety and we had developed a plan, a plan for your anxiety. ; Therapist: And according to my notes, you were going to look into some yoga classes, you were going to attempt to drink less coffee, you were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home and you were going to spend more time in nature. ; Therapist: So I'm wondering how all that went. ; Patient: Well, I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes so I didn't really do that. ; Patient: I did cut back on my coffee a little bit but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning so you know I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups and I did take the dog for a walk but I haven't really gotten out other than that. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals. ; Therapist: You did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes. ; Therapist: You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one and you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk but it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue getting out more with people. ; Patient: Yeah, I don't really like to go out with people. ; Patient: There's usually a lot of chatter and a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in that. ; Therapist: So it's uncomfortable for you to be out around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking and how does that make you feel? ; Patient: It just makes me feel a little bit nervous and then when I get out there I don't really engage in conversation. ; Therapist: So actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious. ; Therapist: So I'm wondering what we could do about that. ; Patient: I'm not really sure. ; Patient: Maybe I could invite people over instead. ; Therapist: That would absolutely be one option. ; Therapist: You could invite people over to your house and then you could get to choose who you're around. ; Patient: Yeah, that's a good idea. ; Therapist: In terms of the yoga, let's get back to the yoga for a minute. ; Therapist: Tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes. ; Patient: I just looked at my gym. ; Patient: I didn't really look anywhere else because I'm already paying to go to a gym and I don't really want to pay extra to go somewhere else so that's why I didn't really look anywhere else. ; Therapist: If I were to ask you right now, how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of 1 to 10? ; Patient: Maybe about a 5 or 6. ; Therapist: What made you say 5 or 6 rather than 2 or 3? ; Patient: I see all these pictures in my news feed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I just want to do it so I'm interested in doing it. ; Patient: It's just really hard. ; Therapist: When you see the pictures on your news feed, it makes you excited about doing it but when you actually go to do it, it makes it a little bit more challenging. ; Patient: I haven't done it before so it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible as the other people. ; Therapist: You're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people. ; Therapist: I'm wondering if that's what yoga is about, flexibility. ; Patient: I think that people go to become flexible but I think that maybe some people are already just flexible. ; Therapist: You are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest and you'd be a beginner. ; Patient: I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class. ; Therapist: What do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class? ; Patient: I'd feel embarrassed, I think. ; Patient: If the teacher tried to get me to do it and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose, I think it would be embarrassing. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain poses. ; Therapist: How would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class? ; Patient: I think I'd feel really good. ; Therapist: What do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class? ; Patient: I guess it's just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it. ; Therapist: What would cause you to not be able to do it with the poses? ; Patient: I'm not sure. ; Therapist: I remember when you first came in last week, you told me that when you were younger, you used to be very, very flexible. ; Therapist: I'm wondering what would make that difference between then and now? ; Patient: When I was a kid, I used to just practice and stretch a lot. ; Patient: Now that I don't, I don't have the same flexibility. ; Patient: As long as I've gotten older, I've lost a lot of flexibility. ; Therapist: How would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be? ; Therapist: Embarrassed? ; Patient: It would be okay, but I don't like that feeling. ; Therapist: What would be the payoff, do you think, if you put up with a little bit of embarrassment? ; Patient: I probably feel really good in the end. ; Therapist: You know, I can give you, I have lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down. ; Therapist: As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. ; Therapist: So I'm not sure if you knew that or not. ; Patient: I didn't really know that. ; Patient: I just thought that yoga was more about flexibility. ; Patient: I didn't realize there were so many other benefits. ; Therapist: So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of 1 to 10? ; Patient: Well, I probably, if I thought that I'd be, it would make me less anxious. ; Patient: I think I'd probably be around an 8 or 9. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Good. That's a definite improvement! ; Therapist: And you could determine after that first class whether your anxiety levels had decreased or not. ; Therapist: Would that be validation for you or would that give you even more motivation if your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class? ; Patient: I think that would be a lot of motivation to continue. ; Therapist: So one other thing that I wanted to mention to you was you said that you had walked your dog in nature. ; Therapist: And I'm curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature? ; Patient: Well, it was only about 30 minutes. ; Patient: It was really cold and windy so we didn't want to stay out. ; Patient: And by we, I mean the dog and I. ; Therapist: And so because it was cold and windy you decided to kind of cut the walk short. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that's definitely understandable. ; Therapist: I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day. ; Patient: Well, it might help if I take a jacket next time. ; Therapist: Okay, so if you took a jacket in case it's cold. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful that you could be in that would help you even more? ; Therapist: Enjoy it? ; Patient: Well, as long as I'm just away from road noise and traffic then it's a lot better. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And there's lots of trails around my house like that. ; Therapist: Okay, excellent. ; Therapist: It's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise. ; Therapist: And so do you think you could commit to an hour? ; Patient: Probably. ; Therapist: And on a scale of one to ten, tell me what that probably means. ; Patient: It's probably a ten. ; Patient: I can commit to that. ; Therapist: Okay, alright. ; Therapist: So it sounds like last week you had a few problems carrying out the assignments towards decreasing your anxiety. ; Therapist: You really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes, but you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you so you could actually do them at home. ; Therapist: How strongly do you feel about doing them at home? ; Patient: If I could do them at home, I would probably do them all the time. ; Patient: I think that would be a big difference. ; Therapist: And then there would be no embarrassment factor if you couldn't do the poses. ; Therapist: Less coffee, you've gone from two cups to one cup. ; Therapist: That's very good. ; Therapist: And get out more with people. ; Therapist: You've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space. ; Therapist: That's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know, you have no control over who's going to be in your space. ; Therapist: And on a scale of one to ten, you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog. ; Therapist: Good job. ; Therapist: I think we have a plan. ; Therapist: So overall, on all four of these items, how motivated do you feel on a scale of one to ten? ; Patient: I think it's a ten. ; Patient: I think I can do them. ; Therapist: On all four? ; Patient: On all four. ; Therapist: Fabulous. ; Therapist: And how do you think you will feel? ; Therapist: If you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week, over the course of next week, how much of a difference do you think it would make you feel? ; Patient: I think it would maybe even make me look forward to doing these things if I were doing them ; Patient: on a regular basis. ; Therapist: And how would it make you feel? ; Patient: I think it would make me feel really good. ; Therapist: And so you'd feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would too. ; Therapist: Very good. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Therapist: We'll check in next week. ; Therapist: We'll make an appointment for next week and catch up and see how you're doing with all this. ; Therapist: Good job. ; Patient: Thank you so much.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Kyle, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing okay I guess. ; Patient: I guess something happened over this past week. ; Patient: I've been looking for a new job since I left my last one and I found this really good job on the internet. ; Patient: But the problem is that the job is working with kids and they have to do a drug test in order for me to get the job. ; Patient: And it kind of like made me think a little bit more about something that I've been considering for a while which is kind of just giving up weed for good. ; Patient: Like I've been thinking about it for a while but I also kind of think about the way weed really helps me. ; Patient: If I'm ever feeling really really anxious about something, I mean weed kind of helps me chill out and helps me relax and I just don't know if I'm ready to give that up yet. ; Therapist: So the marijuana has a real value for you that you don't want to see going. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah it does. ; Patient: It's like a way to self-medicate in a way. ; Therapist: And at the same time you would like this job. ; Therapist: So I could see how this would be in a pinch here. ; Patient: Right, yeah it's kind of like it's put me in a difficult spot. ; Patient: Like I definitely want to get that job but you know if I cut out smoking like I don't know what else I would do. ; Patient: Like if I started to have a panic attack or if I was really like anxious about like anything that I'm worrying about. ; Patient: Like I don't know what I'd do to cope. ; Therapist: Have you ever been treated for anxiety before? ; Patient: I did therapy for a little bit but it was like, I don't know. ; Patient: Back then it was kind of like when the anxiety was just starting so it wasn't too big of a problem. ; Patient: So I like I quit therapy because it wasn't really doing that much. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you take the marijuana for any other reason other than to help with the anxiety? ; Patient: I mean like if I'm bored or maybe if I'm like hanging out with buddies like I don't really have a reason not to do it like until now. ; Patient: But it wasn't like like I really use it whenever I'm like feeling really anxious about something. ; Therapist: So and you may not be able to answer this question but if you didn't have any anxiety would that change your motivation to use marijuana? ; Patient: If I didn't have like any kind of anxiety. ; Patient: Like it would still be kind of tough to give it up because like if I'm hanging out with my buddies and they offer it to me like that's always pretty chill. ; Patient: But I don't like I really I'm really looking forward to this job and like the benefits of having that job would outweigh the benefits of just like smoking my buddies. ; Therapist: So you're excited about the job? ; Patient: I am. ; Patient: Yeah it's almost kind of a dream job. ; Therapist: Well tell me about it. ; Patient: Well it's working with it's working with kids with autism in the school so like I would be kind of like a almost like a personal TA in a way. ; Patient: So like it's a part of an inclusion program so when the kids are going into the class like I would either sit with them or like maybe back behind the class and kind of like help them out in case something comes up. ; Patient: And it's like since my brother has autism that's like it's that's something that I've always really kind of wanted to work with. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you have real passion for this type of work. ; Therapist: And really the big obstacle here is this marijuana. ; Patient: It is it's like a catch-22 too because it's like I know the job will be great but it's like it's a it's a big step for me to take that job. ; Patient: And it's going to be super it's going to make me super anxious. ; Patient: You know it's going to be like it's going to be a lot of anxiety taking a new job so it's like if I have to give up the marijuana and then like not have another way to cope with anxiety like to get the job it's like a catch-22. ; Therapist: Yeah it's a predicament. ; Therapist: You're kind of weighing both sides of this right. ; Therapist: Now I'm wondering do you have do you think you have like a physical craving for the marijuana? ; Patient: No I mean not really. ; Therapist: So you're really using it recreationally and as an anti-anxiety agent. ; Patient: Yeah yeah pretty much. ; Therapist: So if you were I know you didn't have great success before in therapy to combat anxiety but if you were being treated for anxiety and working that job which it seems like you would really like. ; Therapist: You think you'd be able to stay away from marijuana? ; Patient: I think if the therapy really worked I would be able to. ; Patient: Like it's just so easy now just to kind of light up like that's an easy fix and like I don't think therapy is going to be that instant so like it would it would be tough. ; Patient: I think if I had real confidence that the therapy would work I could do it but I mean it would have to it would definitely have to work like just as well as smoking. ; Therapist: You would need to see results. ; Patient: Yeah yeah definitely. ; Therapist: Would having the job that you're passionate about reduce your anxiety? ; Patient: After a while like after I got used to the job but like just starting the new job would make me kind of anxious and then like it would be tough not to not to smoke while doing that. ; Patient: Like I don't I don't even get why they drug test anymore because like it's it's being decriminalized it's being legalized in so many places and there's so much research saying that it's not that bad that it's kind of like it's really upsetting that the place that I really want to work has that policy. ; Patient: I think it's really silly. ; Therapist: You're frustrated marijuana is illegal. ; Patient: Yeah it's yeah. ; Therapist: At the same time it's the reality you're living in. ; Patient: Right yeah it's I think it will be legalized in like in the state in a couple years but until then like I mean I can't wait that long to start start working so. ; Therapist: Until then you still need to address this dilemma. ; Patient: Right yeah it's still a problem. ; Therapist: So you have choices here right? ; Therapist: You can continue to use marijuana and not take the job. ; Therapist: And that seems like something that has some advantages for you but some some disadvantages. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Because you would really like that job. ; Patient: Yeah and I would it's it sounds so pathetic to be like no I don't want to take my dream job because I need weed like sounds really stupid. ; Therapist: So where do you think you are in terms of making this change? ; Therapist: Do you feel motivated to take some steps toward it? ; Patient: I don't like I'm I'm still kind of on the fence because like if I if I have to give it up for the job I could do that but I would definitely need like some other way to get rid of all this anxiety. ; Patient: Like whether it's therapy or whether it's like something else I yeah I would I would definitely need like a substitute if I got rid of it for good. ; Therapist: So you definitely you're saying you definitely need it. ; Therapist: So you can't give up the marijuana unless you have some other available alternative that would help with that anxiety. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: That's the key to you to make this change. ; Patient: Yeah yeah definitely. ; Therapist: But at the same time that would be ideal because then you could take the job. ; Patient: Right yeah I mean I mean if I really thought that I could like get some kind of treatment that was as good as weed yeah I mean I could I could maybe quit especially if it helps ; Patient: to get this job especially. ; Therapist: So with anxiety reduction your chances of stopping marijuana increase and then you could take the job that you want. ; Patient: Yeah yeah I mean that would be the best best outcome. ; Therapist: Is that the outcome you would most want? ; Patient: Yeah I think so. ; Patient: I think I could give up record like dealing with my buddies recreationally. ; Patient: I could yeah I'm just light up a cigarette. ; Therapist: So here's what I'm thinking and let me know what you think about this. ; Therapist: When you come back next week right what if we start looking at this anxiety? ; Therapist: What if we start you know I start treating this anxiety? ; Therapist: All right and we see if we can get it reduced and kind of work from there because maybe when you start to feel if that works and that anxiety starts to abate it sounds like it would just be easier for you to stop the marijuana usage. ; Patient: Yeah yeah it would be. ; Therapist: What kind of time frame are you going to want in terms of taking this job? ; Patient: I mean the job it has a high turnover rate so like even if I like I need to apply this week but if I don't get in more than likely another position like it will open up like within a month or two. ; Therapist: And when would they drug test you? ; Patient: It would be like right after I apply. ; Patient: So if I applied and then did the interview that's when they would give him the paperwork and I'd have to go get drug tested. ; Therapist: When's the last time you used marijuana? ; Patient: Just a couple days ago. ; Therapist: So you see what I'm getting at? ; Patient: Yeah yeah it's a yeah so I like I wouldn't be able to do I wouldn't be able to make it this application but I mean I would like to be off it by the next one. ; Therapist: So you're fortunate in the sense that the turnover is high. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So that's an opportunity to apply later on. ; Therapist: So do you feel like you could invest in that plan? ; Therapist: Let's work on the anxiety see what happens with the marijuana see if we can reduce your usage of it or have you stop that altogether and then kind of move toward this job? ; Patient: Yeah yeah I could deal with that. ; Therapist: Alright so how about next time you come in we'll start talking about the anxiety and let's see what we can do about that and we'll kind of move from there. ; Patient: Alright yeah sounds good. ; Therapist: Sounds good? ; Patient: Mm hmm. ; Therapist: Alright thanks Kyle. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Laura, thanks for coming in. ; Therapist: So I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. ; Therapist: If it's okay I'll give you a little rundown. ; Therapist: So basically we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, get to know you a little bit better, and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. ; Therapist: It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. ; Therapist: Basically I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's gonna be most beneficial for you. ; Therapist: Does that sound okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright so I guess just to get started can you tell me a little bit about yourself? ; Patient: Well my name is Laura, I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school. ; Therapist: Okay and what kinds of things do you have planned for your life? ; Patient: Well hopefully go to college, get you know good enough grades to go to college. ; Therapist: That's great. ; Therapist: Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go? ; Patient: I'm not sure yet, maybe a few schools in the area. ; Patient: I'm looking maybe to apply out of state, so I can move away for college. ; Therapist: Cool. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So kind of keeping your options open. ; Patient: Yeah definitely. ; Therapist: Great and do you have an idea about what you might want to study or? ; Patient: Yeah maybe pre-law. ; Therapist: Oh wow ; Therapist: okay that's exciting. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright cool. ; Therapist: What do you like to do for fun? ; Patient: Well on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party or go to the mall to shop or if there's like a school related event we'll go to like a football game or something like that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I like to have a good time. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you have a lot of friends or a few close people? ; Patient: I would say like a modern amount. ; Patient: I'm not really really popular or like I have no friends. ; Patient: I'm like normal. ; Therapist: That's a good way to be right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright so it sounds like in general your things are going pretty well for you. ; Therapist: How are your grades right now? ; Patient: They're pretty good A's and B's so I'm doing okay. ; Therapist: Okay great. ; Therapist: Well one thing I want to ask about is you know different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. ; Therapist: They might you know be really close with family or really have you know their friends as being something particularly important. ; Therapist: I'm going to show you just a few things on this sheet and if you can look them over so there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination, and spirituality. ; Therapist: Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? ; Therapist: Family definitely, friendship, and belonging. ; Therapist: Okay what's important to you about your family? ; Patient: Well I love them so I want them to think well of me and I want them to be accepting and love me. ; Therapist: Okay and you have brothers or sisters? ; Patient: Yeah I have one sister. ; Therapist: Okay great and how about friendship? ; Patient: Friendship I've grown close to many people that I care about so I would like them to be accepting of me as well. ; Therapist: Great so being a good friend and having people who are good friends too is important. ; Therapist: And then what about belonging? ; Therapist: You mentioned that one too. ; Patient: Yeah just a sense of like fitting in and not and like being accepted in general. ; Therapist: Yeah not wanting to be part of a group. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay great. ; Therapist: Alright well one of the things I want to talk about is you know you mentioned that you like to go out with friends and party and that sort of a thing and I'm curious when you're at the parties do you ever have any alcohol? ; Patient: Um not much maybe like one or two drinks at the most. ; Therapist: Okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? ; Patient: Um I pretty much just have a drink just just have it like so it looks like I'm drinking even though I'm not so maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. ; Therapist: Okay you're kind of getting pressure from other people who are drinking and it feels easier for you to hold a drink. ; Patient: Yeah just have one there and pretend you have it. ; Therapist: Okay and do you think that this is most weekends or occasionally how often do you think that you are around alcohol? ; Patient: Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most. ; Therapist: So one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay and what sort of situations are you in? ; Patient: Well just I guess at a party or something someone's house. ; Therapist: Uh-huh. ; Patient: Or even if it's not a party like a small social gathering maybe there'll be like a few beers around. ; Therapist: So mainly just kind of hanging out with friends? ; Patient: Pretty much yeah. ; Therapist: Are you ever places where there are parents around or mostly just just with the kids? ; Patient: Mostly just with us but sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to their family as well so we'll all just hang out. ; Therapist: And what about driving? ; Patient: Um like drunk driving? ; Therapist: Yeah do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? ; Patient: Definitely not I've never drunk driven and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. ; Therapist: So that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. ; Patient: Yeah because I know that's extremely dangerous. ; Therapist: Okay what do you know about how that's dangerous? ; Patient: Well alcohol definitely impairs your judgment so I mean driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that so I'd rather not be in that situation. ; Therapist: So you're really trying to be safe and make sure that you're not putting yourself in that situation. ; Therapist: That's great you know it's it's tough to do sometimes and I really commend you for being able to to stick with that. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: So you mentioned you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. ; Therapist: What do you think's the most alcohol you've ever had in in one day? ; Patient: No more than two drinks. ; Therapist: Okay so the the absolute most. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay and what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? ; Patient: I've never really been drunk so I can't really say that I like that feeling or not but it's just I mean you're just in a good mood. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm so it just kind of makes you feel relaxed? ; Patient: Yeah yeah relaxed. ; Therapist: Okay anything else? ; Patient: No not really like I said I don't drink that much so I wouldn't be able to tell you. ; Therapist: Okay and any not so good things about alcohol? ; Patient: Definitely yeah I mean when I'm at parties it's up and it's getting a little later some people that drink like drank too much they start throwing up or they get hurt or they're really loud and obnoxious and that's not fun for anybody. ; Therapist: So you've seen a lot of other kids who had some consequences and decided that's not for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Got it. ; Therapist: I can understand that. ; Therapist: Any other things that you can think of? ; Patient: No I mean I've never you know been friends with anybody that's got into like a serious accident and stuff it's just very like obnoxious thing. ; Therapist: Okay well so you know as someone who's not 21 yet it is underage drinking is something that's not illegal and it is something that is considered pretty risky so I wonder what you think about that just in terms of how it fits into your life? ; Patient: Um I know it's definitely risky but I mean I guess we still do it. ; Therapist: Uh-huh so it's kind of something that you're... It's just there. ; Therapist: It's just there okay and I'm curious you mentioned you know your friends are important to you and your family is important to you and sort of fitting in is important to you and how does alcohol play a role with that? ; Patient: Um well definitely not in my family life because my parents don't really condone alcohol use but friendships I mean when I'm hanging out with my friends or we're at a party or something there's usually alcohol involved. ; Therapist: Okay so from your family perspective the drinking is not something that fits very well. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And with friends you feel like it's easier to hang out with alcohol or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your friends wouldn't like you as much. ; Patient: I guess I mean this is just there. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Ties in with the whole belonging thing. ; Therapist: Okay well when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward in five years or ten years how do you think the drinking might fit in with your life? ; Patient: It probably will have a very small role if any in my life considering I have big plans for my future. ; Therapist: Okay can you expand on that a little bit more what do you mean? ; Patient: I mean I don't think I would be you know drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school or in college or trying to get it off school things like that. ; Therapist: Okay so the alcohol something that might make it harder to reach your goals. ; Patient: Yeah definitely. ; Therapist: So when you're sort of looking ahead how often do you think you might be drinking say when you get to college? ; Patient: Maybe less than I am now I mean I don't drink much anyway so maybe like one drink every once in a blue moon. ; Therapist: Okay so you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually. ; Therapist: How might that go? ; Patient: Well I mean I guess right now I would try to stop in high school and once I get older maybe just like socially once in a while but not anything big or anything. ; Therapist: Yeah so you don't feel the need to make any major changes but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier. ; Patient: Definitely yeah that's a good word. ; Therapist: Okay how important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all important not something you're thinking about and ten is the most important thing? ; Patient: Maybe a five or six. ; Therapist: And why'd you say five or six rather than like two or three? ; Patient: Because it's not something I do not care about at all but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. ; Therapist: Okay so it is something you have thought about. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? ; Patient: I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. ; Patient: I'm not really into that whole scene so it's not gonna be difficult for me. ; Therapist: So what number do you think you'd say? ; Patient: On a scale of one to ten if I can quit or not? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Maybe like an eight or nine. ; Therapist: Okay and why'd you say eight or nine rather than even like five or six? ; Patient: Because like I said it's not a big part of my life so it's not really that difficult. ; Therapist: Okay all right well kind of keeping that in mind it sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point and it's moderately important to you it's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. ; Therapist: What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? ; Patient: Probably to stop maybe next party I go to not have a drink at all. ; Therapist: Okay do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? ; Patient: Yeah I mean I can just tell my friends my friends aren't really that pressuring it's just like outside people that I don't really know that well so I could just tell them hey I don't feel like having a drink today. ; Therapist: What might be some benefits of following through with that goal? ; Patient: Definitely I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. ; Therapist: Uh-huh Anything else? ; Patient: Um health concerns I guess I know alcohol is bad for your health so that would be one. ; Therapist: Okay so it's it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore at least at the next party and seeing how it goes? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if it's working out for you? ; Patient: Yeah that would be okay. ; Therapist: Alright great and then it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits and having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers deal with. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Okay well very good. ; Therapist: Is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? ; Patient: Um how would you advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking? ; Therapist: Oh that's a great question so a lot of times kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol but of course that's harder if you're not the one planning so some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say and there's already alcohol there and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends. ; Therapist: Some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are you know carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it so you know even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or you know if people are having a mixed drink just having the Coke say without any alcohol mixed into it. ; Therapist: Often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something in your hand and it kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. ; Therapist: Do you think any of those things might work for you? ; Patient: Yeah for sure. ; Therapist: Okay what about in terms of talking to your friends about it have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking? ; Patient: I was just planning on playing them that I never really want to drink anymore that wasn't me. ; Therapist: Uh-huh your friends would be pretty comfortable with that. ; Patient: Yeah I mean my closest friends for sure. ; Therapist: Okay great any other concerns or questions anything else I can help with? ; Patient: No I think I'm okay. ; Therapist: Okay so then like I said I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going and then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks then we can maybe problem-solve together. ; Patient: Okay great. ; Therapist: That sound okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right thanks so much. ; Patient: No problem.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, Kyle. ; Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: Pretty good, Dr. Grande. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well. ; Therapist: Thanks for asking. ; Therapist: What's been going on? ; Patient: I've been applying to doctorate programs for this upcoming fall, and I'm kind of stuck because I got into two of the schools that I was looking at. ; Patient: I got into both of them, and both of their programs are really good. ; Patient: Both of them have great research track records and kind of what I want to do. ; Patient: Yeah, but the problem is I don't know how to decide between the two now. ; Therapist: Okay, so you applied to two places, and you got in both. ; Therapist: It sounds like both have programs that are really well suited to what you want to do. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And you're having difficulty deciding which one to go with. ; Patient: Yeah, I've always had trouble with indecisiveness, and it's like when I have two choices of something that's very similar, I always get stuck. ; Patient: It's very hard for me to actually make a decision. ; Therapist: Well, let's start at the beginning. ; Therapist: You definitely want to go on for a PhD. ; Therapist: So we've established that. ; Therapist: So it's going to be one of these programs either way. ; Therapist: So really the only question you're really left with is which one. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So oftentimes these situations we look at pros and cons. ; Therapist: Well, it sounds like there's a lot of pros to each one. ; Patient: Are there any cons to either one? ; Patient: I mean, really not any that I can think of. ; Patient: I've tried to write them down on a piece of paper, do the pros and cons, and the pros look very close, and it's like the same number. ; Patient: But I mean, both programs are good. ; Patient: I have connections with some of the teachers in both of them. ; Patient: They're both in the same city. ; Patient: They're really close to each other. ; Patient: They're both very similar, but for some reason I just don't know. ; Patient: It would be easier if there's some cons to one of them. ; Patient: It would make the decision easier if you had some negatives for one of the programs and weren't there for the other one. ; Therapist: So in a way, I guess this is what we call a quote unquote good problem. ; Therapist: It's a problem, but you're choosing between two alternatives that are both really positive for you. ; Therapist: But it's still a choice. ; Therapist: It's still tough. ; Therapist: And you mentioned before that you had some in your past, you're indecisive. ; Therapist: So maybe what we can do in this process is help you build decision-making skills or contribute to that ability because whichever program you get into or you choose, you're going to have to make decisions later on too. ; Therapist: And probably there, maybe some of those will be easier. ; Therapist: Maybe some of those choices won't be as easy. ; Therapist: So I think this would be a matter of looking at what's important to you. ; Therapist: You mentioned the research agenda or agendas at both universities. ; Therapist: That's important to you. ; Therapist: What are the aspects, and maybe not so much thinking about these two universities, but in general, if you had to rank one of them, what aspects are really the most important? ; Patient: Well, definitely the research is up there. ; Patient: I definitely want to get that out of whichever school I go to. ; Patient: I think something else that's important is for the university to have kind of like maybe a post-doctorate plan, whether they have connections with like businesses where I can get a job like right after I graduate, or like if I was going to move into a faculty position, like if they kind of had a pathway that would help set me up for that, like that, those are probably the biggest, like the biggest influencers. ; Patient: The research and not a guarantee necessarily, but some high probability of employment. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So really what we could do here, if you want to look at these two universities, even though we don't really have any negatives to look at, we can rank these positives. ; Therapist: So it sounds like both have the research that you're looking for, that they're both there, but if you could rank, and maybe you don't have this information right now, but if you could rank them in terms of the next most important aspect, which is really how hard will you work to find me a job? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: That's kind of what you're saying. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: I mean, it sounds like what you're saying. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So do you have an information or is that something you can find? ; Patient: Actually, I never thought about that. ; Patient: Like I guess I could go online and kind of look at, a lot of times universities put up like job acceptance rates like afterwards, and they put up percentages, kind of like what people do afterwards. ; Patient: So maybe if I looked at the websites and kind of found the information to see like how many of them go on to be professors or like work in the industry, maybe I should check that out. ; Patient: That might help me. ; Therapist: That might allow you to have a different difference between them. ; Therapist: Because right now it's like they're just kind of melded together. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: You have really no way yet to separate them. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So maybe this can build a bit of a discrepancy, a bit of a gap between them, so you can say, okay, this one, neither one is bad. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But this one might be a little better for what I want to do. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that kind of- ; Patient: Yeah, that makes sense. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Similarly, as you think about it, I know whenever I leave, you know, speaking with somebody or in some situation, that's where I always think of all the questions I wanted to ask. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So when you leave here, you can consider some of the other aspects and like think it over. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: It's really important to me. ; Therapist: And try to create that distance between them so you can look at them as really two separate entities. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Another possibility would be to find out this information, maybe talking to representatives from each university. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And seeing if they may or may not have more information about potential pros and they might even have some cons. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: You know, I'm sure they'll present in a polite manner, but they can let you know maybe some of the negatives associated with the other university or maybe some of the positives that aren't quite as positive. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Something that they do well with others, other university doesn't do as well. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds like this information gathering would really be your next step. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I never actually thought about ranking the pros and going from there. ; Patient: So I think that's a good idea. ; Patient: I like that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And one of the things that might be helpful to drive you is what importance you place on these different aspects. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So kind of clarify and we can, we may again, we'll talk about this, but clarify your values and what's important to you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then that'll help you to kind of rank some of these attributes. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah, that makes sense. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Let's leave it there and we'll kind of pick up next time with looking at what we talked about unless you have any further questions. ; Patient: No, no. ; Patient: I think, yeah, I think I know what I can do afterwards to help me decide. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So I'll see you in about a week and we'll pick up there. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: Sounds good. ; Patient: Thanks, Scott.",

; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you understand my obligations to report certain things. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you answered some other questions in that packet that you filled out with the informed consent. ; Therapist: It's actual type questions. ; Therapist: Information might be on your driver's license or insurance card, things like that. ; Therapist: I'm going to be asking you more emotionally oriented questions as part of this part of the intake. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Some of the topics we'll be covering are sensitive for many people and you may not want to talk about it and that's okay. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: So if I stumble upon one of those topics, you know, I discuss it, just let me know and we don't have to talk about it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: If there's an area that you don't want to talk about right now but you want to talk about later, we can talk about it later. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So how are you referred here to our agency? ; Patient: Well, I have this friend that I've known her forever and she told me that she was really concerned about the way I was living my life and that, you know, I should be coming here. ; Patient: So as a favor to her, I'm here. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you're here as a favor to your friend. ; Therapist: Do you feel committed to counseling? ; Patient: I mean, I guess there's some things I can work on, but I mean, they have problems that I really just don't have. ; Therapist: And when you say they, who are you referring to? ; Patient: Some of my other friends, the friend that referred me. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So there's some elements that they're observing and reporting to you, but you're not quite seeing them. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you think they might not be there at all? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Fair enough. ; Therapist: So I want to talk about what we refer to as the presenting problem. ; Therapist: I know you indicated you're here because a friend referred you, but in terms of the, any symptoms or any problems, issues that might be going in your life, are any of those you can identify, you could talk about? ; Patient: Well, I mean, I will admit I do get angry a lot. ; Therapist: Anger? ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And sometimes when I get mad, I break a few things. ; Patient: I'll punch a wall, I won't hit anybody. ; Patient: So I mean, that's not a problem, you know, but I'll take it out on something that doesn't feel pain. ; Patient: I thought that was a good thing. ; Therapist: So inanimate objects are the target of some physical and angry behavior. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: But not people. ; Patient: No, not people. ; Therapist: So do you view anger as a problem you want to work on? ; Patient: I guess I could work on being less angry. ; Patient: I don't think I have a anger problem, but I can be less angry. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So one of the symptoms would be anger. ; Therapist: You don't necessarily feel like it's a large problem, but you could be less angry. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: You'd be okay. ; Patient: I mean, I think everybody can work on being a little more peaceful. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That makes sense. ; Therapist: Anything else? ; Patient: Now, this is something I have tried to stop before, but I'm having a problem. ; Patient: I do smoke marijuana a lot. ; Patient: I'm not even going to lie to you. ; Patient: A lot. ; Patient: Um, and recently I've been getting into like snorting some drugs. ; Therapist: Can you tell me what drugs? ; Patient: Like Xanax. ; Patient: And I've tried to stop before and it didn't work, but I mean, I like it. ; Patient: So it's kind of like that. ; Patient: Do I really want to give it up? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: You seem a little more torn on that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you say a lot of marijuana. ; Therapist: And that can mean something different depending on the person. ; Therapist: What's it mean to you? ; Patient: Several times during the day. ; Patient: Even when I'm at work, I'll go to my car on break. ; Therapist: Does anybody notice that? ; Patient: I mean, the place I work at isn't very professional, I guess. ; Patient: I mean, there are managers that I hide it from, but everybody there pretty much knows. ; Therapist: They're okay with it. ; Therapist: And you mentioned specifically Xanax and Benzodiazepine. ; Therapist: Any other drugs? ; Patient: Uh, no. ; Patient: It's just mainly the marijuana and then I've started the Xanax. ; Therapist: That seems like it's more recent. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, within the past four months, a friend introduced it to me and started to like it. ; Therapist: How often do you use that? ; Patient: About once less often, I'd have to say about maybe twice every weekend. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And the marijuana sounds more like an everyday thing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Any other drugs? ; Therapist: Pretty much it? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No more drugs. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about in your past? ; Patient: In my past, I have experimented with cocaine, but I kind of got in trouble with the DUI for that. ; Patient: Had to stop that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Anything else? ; Therapist: No. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Any other problems you identify to work on? ; Patient: Um, I can sometimes let my pride get in my way. ; Therapist: Pride? ; Therapist: Tell me a little bit about that. ; Patient: I don't like being told I'm doing something wrong. ; Patient: Because most of the time I'm not or I'm doing it in a way, like just because I'm not doing it your way doesn't mean I'm doing it wrong. ; Patient: I know what I can do and I know what I'm capable of. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So is somebody telling you that you're acting in a way that's proud? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I've had several people. ; Patient: I've lost a few friends because over, you know, little things that I won't budge on. ; Patient: For example, things like, you know, like what the best TV show is. ; Patient: I know what the best TV show is and anybody who says any different is wrong. ; Patient: But I've lost friends. ; Patient: But you know what? ; Patient: Maybe they're not real friends. ; Therapist: So you're indicating pride, but it sounds like maybe inflexibility is a part of it too. ; Patient: I guess. ; Therapist: Has anybody ever said that to you? ; Patient: I mean, not in that word, but I mean, now that you say it, I guess, yeah. ; Therapist: You think that's kind of together with the pride? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You feel like, okay. ; Therapist: Is that a fair adjective, inflexible? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So we have anger, mostly the objects though. ; Therapist: Not at people. ; Therapist: Marijuana, a lot. ; Therapist: Xanax, not as much. ; Patient: Occasionally. ; Therapist: Occasionally. ; Therapist: And then inflexibility and pride. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Does that sound like an accurate? ; Patient: I mean, yeah, that really would. ; Therapist: Accurate list. ; Patient: Not that I hate to admit it. ; Patient: It does. ; Therapist: So it's tough for you to talk about this part? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Heidi, I appreciate your participation in the intake so far. ; Therapist: I want to change to a new section, if that's okay with you. ; Therapist: And this section is on substance use. ; Therapist: Is that an area you feel comfortable discussing? ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So are there any substances that you currently use? ; Patient: I drink a bit. ; Therapist: Can you tell me how often you drink? ; Patient: I guess it's more than a bit. ; Patient: I would say I have probably three drinks a day. ; Therapist: And what are you drinking? ; Patient: Beer. ; Therapist: Do you know what size? ; Patient: The bottles, I think they're 16 ounces. ; Therapist: Three bottles of beer a day? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How long does it take you to consume those? ; Patient: Probably a couple of hours. ; Therapist: So every day, three beers in about two hours. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Does that do anything to you in terms of your mood or feeling? ; Patient: It just kind of helps me unwind after a long day of work, relaxes me. ; Therapist: So it's relaxing for you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Has it ever gotten you into any type of trouble? ; Patient: There was one time that my friends and I kind of got into a fight after I had been drinking. ; Patient: And we almost stopped talking because of it, but we were able to work it out. ; Patient: But I've almost lost friends over it before. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Is there any other areas where it might disrupt functioning? ; Patient: Sometimes it's hard to get up and get to work the next morning after I've had... ; Patient: If I drink it later in the day, it's hard to get up and get to work on time the next morning. ; Patient: So I've been late a couple of times too. ; Therapist: So three bottles of beer pretty much every day? ; Patient: Pretty much every day. ; Therapist: Pretty much every day. ; Therapist: Has there ever been a time when you've consumed more or less in a particular day? ; Patient: Not typically during the week, but sometimes I'll drink more on the weekends. ; Patient: Maybe drink my normal three in a couple of hours and then maybe three or four hours later I'll have a couple more. ; Therapist: You have a few more? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how long have you been drinking alcohol? ; Patient: I guess I started when I was around 17. ; Therapist: 17? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Now you mentioned beer. ; Therapist: Have you ever consumed any other type of alcohol? ; Patient: I've tried wine and shots before, but I always kind of just gravitate more towards the beer. ; Therapist: Back towards the beer? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any other substances that you use currently? ; Patient: On the weekends as well I'll smoke some pot with my friends Saturday night. ; Therapist: That's pretty much just weekends? ; Patient: Sometimes during the week before I go to sleep I'll have a joint. ; Patient: It helps my anxiety and my worries before I go to bed. ; Therapist: When did you first start using marijuana? ; Patient: That was probably a couple years ago when I first started college. ; Therapist: About two years ago? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And on the weekends sometimes other times? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Actually I guess it's more on the weekends, but I would say maybe every other day during the week. ; Therapist: So mostly on the weekends, occasionally during the week. ; Therapist: Has it ever led to any trouble or change of functioning? ; Patient: Not, I mean on the weekends no because I don't really have anywhere to be, but sometimes during the week if I, again kind of like the alcohol, if I smoke it too late again it's hard to get up in the morning and get to work on time and my boss is really starting to get irritated with me with how often I've been late. ; Patient: Not that I'm like super late, but I'm late enough. ; Therapist: Have you ever tried to cut down on the substance use, alcohol, or marijuana? ; Patient: I've tried to cut back on the alcohol before, about a year ago I tried. ; Patient: When I started this job that I have now, I tried to cut back when I first started and I was able to get down to like two, one or two beers instead of three, but then the job got stressful and I got comfortable I guess and started drinking more again. ; Therapist: So you think perhaps the alcohol use is connected to the stress of your job? ; Patient: I would say it's definitely connected. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Have you ever been annoyed by people that perhaps criticize your substance use? ; Patient: Yeah, my family can be critical of, they don't really know about the marijuana, but they can be critical of my alcohol use. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: And that bothers you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your substance use? ; Patient: I've felt guilty with my mom because it upsets her so much sometimes, like I'll feel guilty about how my substance abuse upsets her. ; Patient: And sometimes I feel bad like if I have a fight with my friends, if I'm drunk I'll feel bad the next day about getting into an argument with them because it's usually over something silly. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Have you ever had to drink or use drugs first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to lessen the effects of a hangover? ; Patient: I would say not during the week, but on the weekends when I'll drink a little bit more, sometimes I'll have just a little bit. ; Patient: If I drink Saturday night I'll have a little bit Sunday morning to just get going. ; Therapist: So on occasion that happens? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I wouldn't say it's often, but on occasion. ; Therapist: So alcohol and marijuana, two substances you currently use. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about substances you've used in the past? ; Patient: I had a party one time, I tried Ecstasy, but I didn't like it and I ended up not really hanging out with those people anymore so it wasn't an issue. ; Therapist: So just the one time? ; Patient: Yeah, just the one time. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Patient: In high school my friends, a lot of my friends were smokers, so I smoked cigarettes but it just made me feel sick and I didn't really like it very much, it didn't really do anything for me. ; Patient: So that didn't last long. ; Therapist: She discontinued? ; Patient: Yeah, that didn't last long at all. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Any other substances or just those two? ; Patient: Just those two that I'm currently using and then just the smoking and the Ecstasy previously. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do you have a family history of substance use? ; Patient: My grandfather, my mom claims that my grandfather was an alcoholic. ; Therapist: Any other history? ; Patient: No, not that I'm aware of at least. ; Therapist: Before I move to the next section of the intake, while we're still talking about substance use, is there anything else you want to add? ; Therapist: Any other comments you want to make about this section? ; Patient: I think so, I think that covers it. ; Therapist: Does that cover it pretty well? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: I appreciate you answering these questions and if you're okay I'm going to move from the section and move to the next section of the intake. ; Patient: Okay.",

; Patient: I have my bachelor's degree, and we got a little bit of training. ; Patient: You know, every so often we get some training at work and stuff like that. ; Therapist: Are you evaluated at work by anybody to see if you're doing the job you should be? ; Patient: Yeah, I have a supervisor, so they check up on stuff, and also if I feel like I have questions and stuff like that, I can go to them as well. ; Therapist: Have you been found in that system to be somebody who's satisfying the requirements of, in terms of competency, satisfying the requirements of an employee? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I haven't been fired, so that's a good sign, I guess. ; Therapist: That's a good sign. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: You haven't been fired. ; Therapist: Have you ever had any type of write-up or somebody discussing something with you? ; Patient: No, I just kind of feel like maybe the climate has changed a little bit at the office after this happened, like maybe other people think I didn't make the right decision. ; Patient: I guess maybe that's part of where all my doubts are coming from, like no one has said to me, and I haven't, you know, my supervisor hasn't called me in and said, I'm concerned about this, but I just feel like maybe other people think that I did something wrong. ; Therapist: All right, so there's no evidence supporting that in a kind of a direct fashion, like a supervisor coming to you, but there's other evidence supporting it based on what you're feeling and how you're maybe perceiving things. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you're getting this feeling that by the way they're interacting with you, by the way they're relating to you, that... ; Patient: Yeah, which I guess maybe I shouldn't be that freaked out about because there have been other people who have made mistakes and like the supervisors have talked to them and, you know, even then they didn't lose their job, so it's not like, you know, I have, you know, I don't know, I guess it's not like just hearing them or thinking that they're judging me is an indication that something terrible is going to happen or that I made this huge mistake. ; Therapist: All right, so you can see that, from talking this through, you can see that some of this could be feelings, thoughts you're having combined with what you're actually observing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And it's not like you're filtering your observations in a way that's maybe making them seem a little more destructive, a little more negative. ; Patient: Yeah, it's kind of like I know it's not that big of a deal because, like I said, my supervisor hasn't talked to me and it's not like I've heard anything terrible about anything happening to the kids or anything like that, but I just feel like, you know, I have those thoughts like oh, was she, you know, saying something, you know, when she said that, was she referring to what happened and stuff like that. ; Therapist: Can you provide an example of an interaction with a coworker where they said something that you thought maybe was referring back to this? ; Patient: Yeah, so like we were having like a regular work meeting and we kind of like, you know, discussed how things are going and it's been kind of a big deal, you know, more so than usual because the kids were removed from this family, so, you know, one of my coworkers kind of nudged me and said like, oh, you're the bulldozer, you know, you plowed right through that family and took those kids away and, you know, I think she meant it kind of like as a joke and just, you know, maybe to say like, you know, you did what you needed to do, but it kind of made me feel like, does she think that I'm just callous? ; Patient: Like does she think that I just didn't care and, you know, you get what I'm saying? ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, so she referred to you as a bulldozer and one way to take that would be powerful, efficient, but another way to take that would be kind of destructive. ; Therapist: We talked about before, destructive, callous, they're mechanical, they don't have a lot of feeling. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, you don't know exactly how she meant it, but you're thinking maybe it was connected ; Therapist: that way. ; Patient: Yeah, and I guess it kind of like, it goes back to like my fear that I didn't think it through, that I kind of just, you know, I made the report and that was that and, you know, it makes me feel like, was I being mechanical? ; Patient: Did I just, was I just nonchalant about it? ; Patient: Should I have put more thought into it? ; Patient: And it really, you know, it hit me where it hurt, I guess, you know. ; Therapist: So her saying that really kind of brought up this thought that maybe you are, maybe you are not empathetic enough or compassionate enough. ; Patient: Yeah, or even just thoughtful. ; Patient: I guess maybe I was just being, you know, just going about my job without putting a lot of thought into what I was doing. ; Therapist: It's automatic. ; Patient: Which is, exactly. ; Therapist: So maybe one thing you would have done differently in light of that comment, at the time make a decision you would have thought through the steps more? ; Patient: Yeah, maybe taken a little bit more time. ; Patient: But at the same time, I mean, I don't have a ton of time. ; Patient: I've been good at my job. ; Patient: I've been doing things that way, but then it just kind of made me think, have I been missing stuff all along? ; Patient: I don't know.",

; Patient: I think I lost track after four or five. ; Therapist: How long had it been since you had a drink before that? ; Patient: I did really well. ; Patient: It was I think like three weeks or so. ; Therapist: So you did really well and then you had one drink and that just made you feel like you weren't successful. ; Patient: I felt like a loser. ; Therapist: You felt like a loser. ; Therapist: And you feel that kind of led to drinking some more. ; Therapist: So you had a rough time with things. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about now? ; Patient: I mean now I just kind of, I don't know, I'm afraid to go back. ; Patient: I'm afraid to go out with some friends. ; Patient: They invite me out to dinner. ; Patient: But I know there's alcohol. ; Therapist: Is that where you were when you had that first drink? ; Therapist: Was out with friends? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: There's a few things going on. ; Therapist: We've talked in the past about separating the behavior from the person. ; Therapist: So behavior is what we do, not who we are. ; Therapist: Do you remember those discussions? ; Therapist: And correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like, I'm going to use some different words than you used, but it sounds like when you had that first drink, you're kind of ashamed that you had a drink and you had it during the time when you would have been working. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: That's pretty accurate. ; Therapist: That's pretty accurate. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So taking yourself kind of back to that moment, right, where you had that first drink, like you finished that first drink. ; Therapist: What was your thought at that moment? ; Patient: Just like, shameful. ; Patient: Like I did really, really well and then here I was and I just finished a drink and I knew I wanted another one. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So shameful is kind of like the feeling, but the thought is I did really, really well. ; Therapist: So that's what you were thinking, was I did really, really well. ; Therapist: And was that the end of the thought or was there more before you had that next drink? ; Patient: I guess just I was doing well and then I had a drink and I just felt like an awful person. ; Patient: So I figured what was the hurt in having more. ; Therapist: So the sequence would have been you had the drink, you felt shameful. ; Therapist: At the same time you're thinking that you were doing really well and then just really, as you said before, you just felt like a loser and then you decided might as well just have the second drink. ; Therapist: So another thought might be that, like I might as well just have the second drink. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you can see how there's some thoughts and some feelings at work right as you finish that first drink. ; Therapist: Was it fairly quick, were those thoughts and feelings fairly, occur very quickly after the drink? ; Patient: Yeah, I would say as I was finishing and then finished. ; Therapist: So right away you regretted it. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And in that regret, as you thought about it, thought might as well just continue drinking now because you kind of blew it. ; Patient: Yeah, I already messed up, I might as well keep going. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And that's a common cycle to fall into and you had three weeks where you hadn't had a drink prior to that. ; Therapist: So let's look at this, let's try to separate the behavior from yourself a little bit. ; Therapist: If you had a friend who was in the same predicament, right, who had a history of using alcohol and then had three weeks without any alcohol use, and then their behavior was to have a drink, what would you think of them? ; Patient: I would think that they had a rough day or something must have happened where, I mean it's just one drink. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: A rough day with one drink, and what would you think of their behavior? ; Therapist: How would you categorize that behavior? ; Patient: It's just they made a mistake. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So not ideal. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Depending on their point of view, maybe a little irresponsible. ; Patient: Yeah, I think irresponsible would be... ; Therapist: Irresponsible? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: But you wouldn't necessarily characterize them as a bad person. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: But their behavior was a bit irresponsible. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You know, in terms of like their recovery plan, which would be to not drink. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But when you apply that same examination to your own situation, how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink? ; Patient: It was my mistake. ; Patient: It was something that... ; Patient: It makes me a worse person for doing it. ; Therapist: So you see how you're being a little, well, it would be quite a bit rougher on yourself. ; Therapist: Like your evaluation of yourself is fairly harsh. ; Therapist: You mentioned loser earlier and ashamed. ; Therapist: Whereas you wouldn't necessarily evaluate somebody else that way. ; Therapist: How would you evaluate your behavior? ; Therapist: How would you judge your behavior taking that first drink? ; Patient: Shameful. ; Patient: I mean, irresponsible. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: And just bad overall. ; Therapist: So bad, irresponsible, shameful. ; Therapist: Is there a way to separate that behavior in terms of your thinking, in terms of the way you evaluate it from yourself? ; Therapist: Like are you in the behavior together, enmeshed, or can you be separated? ; Patient: I think we could be separated. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: But it feels like we're... like I am that behavior. ; Therapist: In that moment, it's very congruent for you. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: The shame matches the behavior. ; Therapist: The behavior matches shame. ; Therapist: Like it's... they're one at that moment. ; Therapist: But really, logically, rationally, you're you. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: Your identity and values and your behavior is something you do. ; Therapist: But in the moment, it's hard for you to see that. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Looking back on it now, are you able to see the distinction between what people do and what they are? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, just because you have one drink doesn't make you a horrible person in the thing, right? ; Therapist: No, certainly not. ; Therapist: And you were clean for three weeks and you had one drink, so really your behavior was a slip. ; Therapist: Right? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And irresponsible in relationship to your goals, I suppose, but still a slip. ; Therapist: And you could have stopped. ; Therapist: But that shame got a hold of you, right? ; Therapist: That thought, well, now I've done it. ; Patient: I blew it. ; Therapist: Yeah, so with that mentality, you kind of set yourself up for drinking more. ; Therapist: So I think this is important because we've seen this cycle, like where you have weeks of sobriety, and then you'll drink a bit and then have weeks of sobriety. ; Therapist: And I'm wondering if part of the difficulty you're facing is you're not coping with the slips as just slips. ; Patient: No way. ; Therapist: You're allowing them to be gateways into a lot more drinking than a slip. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: That sounds pretty accurate. ; Therapist: And you see how the shameful feelings kind of just interfere with the behavior that's really consistent with your goals, which would be to not continue drinking. ; Therapist: Another piece of this, too, is the associating with friends who drink. ; Therapist: You're putting yourself in a treacherous situation. ; Therapist: And again, that's a behavior, right? ; Therapist: That doesn't make you one way or the other. ; Therapist: It's a behavior. ; Therapist: How would you judge that behavior, going out with friends? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Difficult because I like being around those people. ; Patient: But I guess it would be risky. ; Therapist: Risky. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: It's a risky behavior. ; Therapist: And what does it make you? ; Therapist: Who are you? ; Therapist: Because you do that behavior. ; Therapist: How do you feel about yourself when you take that risky behavior? ; Patient: Guilty. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you have guilt and you go out with your friends. ; Therapist: And then you have shame if you drink. ; Therapist: And both, in this case, both emotions that kind of point you in the direction of more drinking. ; Therapist: So part of this behavioral strategy here is to avoid those circumstances, like to recognize that that's a risky behavior which you have. ; Therapist: And the other part would be to deal more effectively if you do so. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Does that separation of what we do and who we are make sense to you rationally? ; Patient: Kind of. ; Therapist: It feels a little unnatural though. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So maybe as you're confronting similar situations in the course of the next week, you could be aware of behaviors that might put you at risk and try to separate your identity from that behavior. ; Therapist: So just judge the behavior. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And don't pass any judgment on yourself. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Kind of, yeah. ; Therapist: It might help you to, since it's a little tough to, because right now the feeling and the judgment are intertwined, right? ; Therapist: It might help to write down when these things happen and kind of write down like one row for, this is how I judge this behavior that I'm thinking about doing and this is how I judge myself. ; Therapist: So if you see a lot of self-judgment, that might be a clue that you're falling into that cycle a little bit. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Where you're making decisions based on that emotion instead of a rational judgment of the behavior. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Would that help a little bit? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I think that would probably be beneficial. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So that will be our plan going forward until next week is note, document your judgment about your behavior. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And any judgment you may have by yourself. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: And there's some insight that can be gained there. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: You kind of distinguished the two. ; Therapist: And make a note of those and try to use that evidence before making a decision that might put you in a risky spot. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Is that the plan? ; Patient: Yeah, I think I can try that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: I'll see you next week and we'll see how you did with those goals. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Bye.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Leigh, I want to thank you for your participation so far in this intake, but I want to move to another section of the intake, specifically your family history, if that's okay with you. ; Therapist: So I'm going to be asking you various questions about your relatives. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Are you adopted? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Are your parents married? ; Patient: They're not married. ; Therapist: They're not married? ; Patient: I mean, to each other. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I mean, my dad, he's now remarried. ; Patient: And while my mom, I mean, which marriage are we talking about? ; Patient: Because she's been married four times. ; Therapist: She's been married four times? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: So. ; Therapist: At what age were you when your parents divorced? ; Patient: I was about 16. ; Therapist: 16? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And then your father, you said remarried? ; Patient: He did. ; Therapist: And how long after the divorce? ; Patient: I think it was about 18. ; Therapist: You were about 18? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And then your mother remarried and was divorced a few times, you're saying? ; Patient: Well, yeah. ; Patient: I mean, it was pretty much right after they got divorced. ; Patient: She married some guy. ; Patient: I don't even know. ; Patient: He was a nice guy. ; Patient: It was like six months after, pretty much like real fast. ; Patient: And then that didn't last very long. ; Patient: Forgive me. ; Patient: I have to remember like how long they were together because there's so many. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: But I believe that they were only together for not even a year. ; Patient: And then she kind of had some time where she just was dating, but it was numerous people. ; Patient: And then she met somebody in her AA meeting and they married. ; Therapist: That lasted, they probably got married, I would say probably two years after the first marriage. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: And then that lasted, I would say roughly about a year and a half to two years. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And then, yeah, the other one was probably when I was about like 25. ; Patient: And then that one lasted the longest. ; Patient: That was her third marriage. ; Patient: So that was about close to three years. ; Therapist: That was her third? ; Patient: I believe that was her third, yeah. ; Patient: Or her fourth. ; Patient: I can't remember. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So it's a, well, she was married to your father. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And then married quickly after that, you said. ; Therapist: And then she met somebody at AA meeting. ; Patient: Yes, that's the third. ; Patient: And then this one would be, oh yeah, the fourth. ; Therapist: The fourth? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And she married now? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: Now she's, I don't know, just dating or whatever. ; Therapist: How long did the last marriage last? ; Patient: So that was three years. ; Patient: That was the longest one. ; Therapist: That was the longest. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: How long was your relationship with your father? ; Patient: It's good, I guess. ; Patient: I mean, my dad, he's a real, he's a genuine guy. ; Patient: I would say that he stuck around for a lot of things with my mom. ; Patient: So I would say that he's a pretty good guy. ; Patient: And I think we have a decent relationship considering what we've been through. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about your relationship with your mother? ; Patient: It's just, honestly, there's no other way to describe it. ; Patient: It's just chaotic. ; Patient: I mean, she's chaotic. ; Patient: So she's all over the place. ; Patient: And it's just hard to capture on a good day. ; Patient: And when you do, it's just, you know, it's kind of surface, our relationship. ; Patient: So. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So who raised you? ; Patient: My parents raised me. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, they were good parents, I guess, according to my standards, because my mom was just always a mess. ; Patient: So I guess they both did the best that they could given some circumstances. ; Therapist: Do you think the way that you're raised has an impact on who you are now in terms of? ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Patient: My mom was, and I hate to like blame my mom, but I am because she was just, my mom has done a lot of things because I know it sounds like weird, but she didn't really sleep a lot. ; Therapist: She was constantly spending my dad's money and shopping. ; Patient: So we were always dressed nice constantly. ; Patient: We were always dressed nice. ; Patient: But my mom was just always preoccupied with herself as far as shopping and just looking good and obsessive with cleaning. ; Patient: And I don't know, it just, that's all I know my mom for. ; Patient: I was just shopping and spending my dad's money and them constantly fighting it. ; Patient: They always stayed together, I think for us, but that's really, she was always kind of gone, like hi-bye kind of throughout my childhood. ; Therapist: There's some tough memories in there too. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about your siblings? ; Patient: I do. ; Patient: I do. ; Patient: I have two siblings. ; Therapist: Okay, two. ; Patient: I have a brother, Jeff and a sister, Kendra. ; Patient: And I mean, they're, they're, they're good siblings, I guess. ; Patient: We kind of just all go one or separate ways when my parents divorced, I guess just because they were just, you just become frustrated and tired with what you grew up with that you just, I guess you just don't want to relive that memory when we're together, we relive that. ; Therapist: So what's your relationship with them now? ; Therapist: What's it like now? ; Patient: It's okay. ; Patient: You know, I guess, I mean, I don't know. ; Therapist: You mentioned that everybody went their separate ways. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I don't really see them quite honestly. ; Patient: So if I do see them and maybe it's like if I show up at a, at a family party once every five years, but so I think to me that's okay. ; Patient: That's right. ; Therapist: You're satisfied with your relationship with them? ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: I mean, you know, it's not my fault that they won't accept who I am. ; Therapist: Are you aware of any medical conditions that like your mother and father may have or your grandparents? ; Patient: Like heart disease or anything like that kind of medical? ; Patient: My grandma had like heart disease. ; Patient: My grandfather had cancer, but he beat that colon cancer. ; Patient: It wasn't like the first stage, but he was fine after. ; Patient: But as far as my parents, they don't have any medical issues that I know of. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about kind of the same question except for mental health conditions? ; Patient: Oh, just crazy. ; Patient: Like my mom was crazy. ; Patient: She was just completely all over the place, I guess. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Are you aware of any formal diagnosis that she had? ; Patient: She was just manic, like I guess like bipolar, but she never really got like a definitive label as bipolar in like therapy or anything like that. ; Patient: But yeah, she was definitely a mess. ; Patient: Like anxiety and just, you know. ; Therapist: So symptoms of bipolar and anxiety. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any other mental health conditions in your family? ; Patient: No, just my mom with her, you know, obsessiveness and she'd get depressed after. ; Patient: But as far as any other siblings, no. ; Therapist: Do you have any special family traditions? ; Patient: I mean, we would go on family vacations when I was a kid. ; Patient: We were constantly staying at the best hotels and stuff like that because our mom, you know, would shop around. ; Patient: She actually would book three hotels and just decide which one she liked better when we got there. ; Patient: I don't, I don't know. ; Patient: But anyway, we would do that. ; Patient: We would go on vacations together. ; Patient: We would always go down to the beach. ; Patient: So that was really our family tradition as far as in like holidays. ; Patient: We did when we were younger, we would have like our family over for Christmas and stuff like that. ; Patient: But. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about holidays? ; Therapist: Like what were the most important holidays to your family? ; Patient: Christmas was; Easter. ; Patient: They were the most important and Thanksgiving. ; Therapist: How did you celebrate those holidays? ; Patient: Sometimes we would go to my cousin's house on my dad's side and Christmas would be at my parents' house and then Easter would, it would just vary back and forth between my cousins or my parents who ever wanted to have it. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about your extended family? ; Patient: My extended family, well on my dad's side my uncle, he's super successful and he's a cool guy. ; Patient: I don't really see him now. ; Patient: But when I was a kid I did. ; Patient: But now I don't see him at all. ; Patient: Honestly. ; Patient: I don't really see anybody at all. ; Patient: But yeah, and on my mom's side she has a sister and she's like crazy but she's not as crazy as my mom. ; Patient: But she has two kids and she's actually still married to her husband. ; Patient: They were actually high school sweethearts. ; Patient: So I don't know where my mom came from. ; Patient: And yeah, I haven't seen her probably since I graduated high school. ; Patient: And you know she associates with my mom and they talk amongst themselves so I don't really have a relationship with her either. ; Therapist: Alright, so not many active relationships there in your family history it sounds like. ; Patient: Well yeah, there's not many now. ; Therapist: Is there anything else you want to tell me about your family history? ; Patient: Um, my mom would drink sometimes when I was growing up. ; Patient: But that's why my mom was really friendly to me when she would drink. ; Patient: And yeah, she would drink. ; Patient: I don't know if that's, you know, she was considered an alcoholic but she would drink often. ; Patient: And I think just to come off of her shopping a lot she would drink or vice versa. ; Patient: Sometimes she would drink while shopping or just to calm down she would drink. ; Patient: And sometimes in her drinking habits she would actually be nice to me. ; Patient: So yeah. ; Therapist: Anything else you want to tell me? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So I want to thank you for helping me complete this family history section of intake. ; Therapist: And if you're okay we'll move on to another section. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Therapist: Alright.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: So, good to see you again. ; Therapist: Last week we were talking about anxiety. ; Therapist: Do you have your diary card? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, let's look at it real quick. ; Therapist: Where is it? ; Therapist: Over here, huh? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, so anxiety is really high. ; Therapist: What happened yesterday? ; Therapist: Anxiety is really high. ; Therapist: Give me a quick summary. ; Patient: Anxiety is always really high, but yesterday was the worst. ; Therapist: Why? ; Patient: I was driving, my dad was driving and I was in the passenger seat and we were in a lot of traffic and that already makes me nervous because I like to be on time. ; Patient: I know, I know. ; Patient: I don't want to be late because then what if I get in trouble? ; Patient: So I was already kind of on edge and then we passed the accident that I guess was causing all the traffic and there were two cars and they were like mashed together like accordions and there was a tarp and I know that under that tarp there was a dead body and the car went right by it. ; Therapist: That's scary. ; Patient: It was horrible. ; Therapist: Kind of explains that number, huh? ; Patient: Yeah, who wouldn't be anxious? ; Patient: That's like a normal thing because there's a dead body. ; Therapist: Well, I'd be anxious, of course, and it's kind of scary to see that and what else did you think when you saw that? ; Patient: Who would drive when there's two cars mashed together like accordions and a dead body? ; Patient: That's insane. ; Patient: It's insane. ; Patient: You have to be insane to drive. ; Therapist: And your family wants you to learn to drive this year because you're 16. ; Patient: They're insane. ; Therapist: Hmm. ; Therapist: And yet you keep complaining how you live in the middle of nowhere and if you had a car you could like go see friends more and get out of your lame old town and get to go do fun things. ; Patient: But I can't see my friends anymore if I'm dead. ; Therapist: True. ; Therapist: That's true and I won't get to see you anymore because you're dead. ; Therapist: I know I don't treat dead people, right? ; Therapist: Remember that? ; Therapist: Yeah, okay. ; Therapist: So on one hand, I know the idea of driving is completely overwhelming and I know you're anxious like all the time. ; Patient: And I get that I have to drive because you're right. ; Patient: It's like the middle of nowhere and I can't just like not go places but... ; Therapist: So I'm wondering if we can bring it back to some of those things you were talking about to help reduce your anxiety. ; Therapist: Maybe that's one idea to help you be able to get in the driver's seat. ; Therapist: What do you think? ; Therapist: So essentially you're practicing getting in the driver's seat by like doing the treatment and getting in the driver's seat of your anxiety as opposed to being a passenger and you're letting your anxiety outside of your life because that's what you're doing. ; Therapist: What do you think? ; Patient: That was a lot of puns, Jen. ; Therapist: I'm punny, aren't I? ; Therapist: So here's an idea. ; Therapist: Let's get on board. ; Therapist: We start treating this anxiety. ; Therapist: We do a really, really good job at it. ; Therapist: We work hard and the idea of driving might not be quite as scary. ; Therapist: And let's face it, being an anxious driver increases your risk of accidents. ; Patient: Well, that's helpful. ; Patient: Thanks. ; Therapist: So reducing your anxiety is going to make you a safer driver. ; Patient: Yeah, but all these things you keep telling me that I have to do to be less anxious, they involve like feeling really anxious. ; Therapist: True. ; Patient: There's no way to like, you're supposed to like just make it go away. ; Patient: You're not supposed to make it worse to make it better. ; Therapist: So, here's something interesting ; Therapist: You're really good at being really anxious. ; Therapist: So you'll be really good at this and it will go away. ; Therapist: I promise you. ; Therapist: Totally promise you. ; Patient: That's so hard. ; Therapist: Well, reality is, you know darn well I'm the expert here of treating anxiety and I promise you it will get better. ; Therapist: I know everything. ; Therapist: I know this. ; Therapist: What do you think? ; Patient: I think it sounds really hard. ; Therapist: It is really hard. ; Therapist: I'm not going to lie to you. ; Therapist: It's totally, totally hard. ; Therapist: But maybe it's just another insane thing that you have to be more anxious to be less anxious. ; Patient: I know. ; Therapist: It is pretty insane, isn't it? ; Therapist: I agree. ; Therapist: Well, another option is you can just be anxious the rest of your life. ; Therapist: Do they have a bus where you live? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: You live with your parents for the rest of your life. ; Patient: I know. ; Therapist: So you can live with your parents for the rest of your life because you're too anxious to leave town. ; Therapist: You won't be able to drive. ; Therapist: So you could just live with your parents, be anxious all the time. ; Therapist: Maybe you could go up with some ideas on how to maintain your anxiety the rest of your life. ; Therapist: You won't need to learn to drive. ; Therapist: I mean, your parents are fairly nice. ; Therapist: They probably drive around for the rest of your life, you know, until they pass away or something. ; Therapist: In the meantime, what about that? ; Therapist: So forget the whole treatment. ; Therapist: I'm pushing you too hard. ; Therapist: Why don't we just talk about how to maintain your anxiety? ; Therapist: You're good at it. ; Patient: No, Jen, that's not funny. ; Therapist: It's not meant to be funny. ; Therapist: What do you think? ; Patient: That's horrible. ; Therapist: I'm trying to help you. ; Therapist: I really want to help you. ; Therapist: I know being anxious every day is really hard. ; Therapist: So one of the options is to really become good at being anxious and do okay and learn to sit with your anxiety. ; Therapist: Another option is, yeah, getting more anxious to reduce your anxiety. ; Patient: So you're saying that kind of no matter what I choose, it's going to involve feeling anxious? ; Therapist: Yeah, but you're practiced at it. ; Patient: Well, I mean, if those are the only options, we might as well do the one that's going to make it eventually go away rather than just be there forever. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you want to review what some of the treatment strategies will be? ; Patient: Yeah, I guess. ; Therapist: Okay, let's do that.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: In this scenario, a client meets with a domestic violence advocate for a local agency that provides low-cost to no-cost counseling for individuals and their families. ; Therapist: This is the fourth time that they have met. ; Therapist: The client has been in her relationship for two years. ; Therapist: She does not have children. ; Therapist: The violence has taken all shapes and forms. ; Therapist: She wants to break up with her partner and is not quite sure how to do so. ; Therapist: She does not fear for her life if she breaks up, but she is concerned that her partner would make problems for her at work and in her community. ; Therapist: Hi Liv. ; Patient: Hi. ; Therapist: Welcome back. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: How are you? ; Patient: I'm feeling pretty intense. ; Patient: Things have kind of gone downhill since I was here last time. ; Therapist: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I know last time we talked, you and Kelly had just gotten engaged and you were rather excited about plans that you had for your life. ; Therapist: So tell me what has happened? ; Therapist: What has shifted? ; Patient: I think that we've just sort of fallen back, you know? ; Patient: I was really hopeful that with the proposal also came the promise to work on the relationship and work on her anger and work on, you know, being the couple that we hope to be. ; Patient: And that's not happening. ; Patient: It's not happening. ; Patient: We're right back to where we were. ; Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. ; Therapist: I know you were excited. ; Therapist: You were feeling hopeful for change and I don't get that same sense from you right now. ; Therapist: In fact, it seems like you're feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless about the situation. ; Therapist: Well, how can I be helpful and supportive and useful to you right now? ; Patient: I just, I don't know how to make change. ; Patient: I don't know how to end this. ; Patient: I don't know how to get out. ; Patient: I don't know how to, I just, I can't do it anymore. ; Therapist: So you've decided to make a change. ; Therapist: And in fact, it sounds like you've decided to leave the relationship. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, I want to, I don't want to be in it, but I don't, I don't know how to get to not being in it. ; Therapist: So you're thinking about it. ; Therapist: It's not that you've committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave the relationship, but correct me if I'm wrong. ; Therapist: What you're saying is you want to make a change and you don't want this relationship as it is right now. ; Therapist: What, what are you, when you think about changing, what, what ideas, I mean, I guess you mentioned leaving. ; Therapist: What other possibilities or thoughts have you had about change and what that might look like? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: It just feels so overwhelming when I think about it. ; Patient: I just, I can't seem to find a way out of it. ; Patient: And that feels, feels ethical. ; Patient: It feels like it, you know, I don't want to hurt her. ; Patient: I just don't want to be in this relationship anymore. ; Therapist: Why don't you want to be in this relationship anymore? ; Patient: It's not healthy. ; Patient: It's I'm not happy. ; Patient: I can't imagine that she's happy, even though she says she is. ; Patient: It's, you know, we're fighting constantly. ; Patient: I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her. ; Patient: She's overprotective. ; Patient: She, yeah, it just, it doesn't feel right. ; Patient: It just doesn't feel right. ; Therapist: It doesn't feel right. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And so, so what would feel right? ; Patient: Oh, that's a huge question. ; Patient: I just don't, I'm not sure. ; Patient: Just this isn't right. ; Therapist: So the way things are is not right. ; Therapist: It's not working. ; Therapist: You don't feel supported. ; Therapist: This isn't the kind of relationship that, that you want or that you had hoped that it would be. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, when we started, it was, it was lovely. ; Patient: She was amazing. ; Patient: She was this super caring and thoughtful woman. ; Patient: And, you know, we were lots of same interests, same friends. ; Patient: It's, you know, she was just fantastic. ; Patient: And I don't know, I don't know where that changed. ; Patient: And I feel like we did this on again, off again stuff. ; Patient: And it was just, it just seems to like, it's just not right. ; Patient: And I know, I know I don't deserve to be treated this way. ; Patient: I know that I'm better than that. ; Therapist: You really value your self and your well being and in your spirit. ; Therapist: And it sounds like you don't feel like you're taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship. ; Therapist: And even though things started out well, they haven't turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourself. ; Patient: No, but you know, but she's lovely. ; Patient: And I love her. ; Patient: And I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without her in it. ; Therapist: So you're feeling torn. ; Therapist: Yeah, you're, you're torn between your love and affection for her, and your sense of honoring yourself. ; Therapist: And you've got a lot of mixed feelings. ; Therapist: And you are saying that you need something to change. ; Therapist: That sounds like you're able to kind of hold that complexity, if you will, that you've got these strong feelings for this person. ; Therapist: And you don't feel like this is the good relationship for you. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I don't think it's good for either one of us. ; Therapist: For both of you. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, so so then you've talked a little bit about leaving. ; Therapist: I mean, tell me more about what you've thought about. ; Therapist: And when you think about making a change in terms of leaving, what what might that look like for you? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, it feels, I just can't imagine my life without her in it. ; Patient: So the idea of not having her there feels really scary. ; Patient: And the idea of staying the way it is, and things not changing, feels even scarier. ; Patient: So I don't, I don't know how to, and I don't even know how I would do that. ; Patient: Our lives are so intertwined. ; Patient: I ; Patient: mean, my business, our friends, the queer community is so small. ; Patient: You know, that's my family. ; Patient: Those are not just my friends. ; Patient: That's my family as well. ; Patient: And so it just, you know, how do you, how do you extract yourself from that, in a way, you know, for me, like, in a way that I feel that I'm doing that with grace and respect for her and respect for myself. ; Therapist: What thoughts do you have about how you do that? ; Therapist: How do you extract yourself? ; Therapist: How might you extract yourself in a way that has some integrity and grace, as you said? ; Patient: I don't even know. ; Patient: I mean, I've talked to my friend Jay about it. ; Patient: And I don't know, he suggested like a break, but I don't know. ; Patient: I just don't want to get caught in that on again, off again before, like, you know, like we've done before. ; Patient: But the idea of a break feels a little less, I don't know, maybe more gentle. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: Say more, a little more gentle. ; Patient: I don't know, to give us both time to really think about it. ; Patient: And I don't know, maybe, maybe she'll change. ; Patient: Maybe, maybe if I'm, you know, if this is it, if this is it, like if this break is it maybe, maybe she'll be able to change. ; Therapist: I heard you say that living, you know, moving on and having a life without Kelly is really scary. ; Therapist: In fact, it's almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like, especially with the way that your lives are so intertwined. ; Therapist: I also heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier. ; Therapist: And I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you mean by that. ; Patient: It's just, I feel exhausted. ; Patient: I feel like I'm not, I'm not who I was when I came into this relationship. ; Patient: I feel like I'm constantly struggling to make her happy and that just doesn't work. ; Patient: There's nothing I can do. ; Patient: And I feel like I've lost my joy. ; Patient: And I don't know. ; Patient: I'm just afraid of what will happen if I just keep staying in a place where I feel like I'm falling apart. ; Patient: Piece by piece. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you're concerned about your own well being and your own joy and your, your spirit if you you stay and don't make this change. ; Therapist: And that's the part that's really scary for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking a little break. ; Therapist: And you said that that was a scary thought for you. ; Therapist: And I guess I'd like to hear more additional thoughts you might have about that as a as an option for you. ; Patient: Well, I did. ; Patient: It seems like I mean, if it could happen, if we could find a way to make it happen that it would be it would just give me some time to think about like what I want and what I need and and you know, I feel like I can't sort out what's me in this anymore. ; Patient: And, and so like if I had that space just to sort of breathe and not have to worry about her feelings and taking care of her and just being able to focus on myself for a little while. ; Patient: I don't know it seems like that would be helpful. ; Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're so in, in it just so in the mixed emotions and the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it's really hard for you to see out of it and an advantage, a reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence, if you will, that sense of not knowing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, if you don't mind, I'd love to ask you to take a look at this ruler here. ; Therapist: I just kind of wrote this down really quickly. ; Therapist: But on a scale of zero to 10, zero being not motivated at all and 10 being extremely motivated. ; Therapist: How motivated would you say you are to take a break in your relationship right now? ; Patient: Oh, like six? ; Therapist: Six? Oh, somewhat motivated? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Why a six and not a one? ; Patient: Because I know it needs I need it. ; Patient: I feel like I'm losing myself. ; Patient: So I feel like it's important. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, so So why six and not a nine or 10? ; Patient: Because I'm not sure how to make it happen. ; Patient: Yeah, I don't I don't know. ; Therapist: So it's important to you. ; Therapist: And you're not maybe fully confident or sure about the how part. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, kind of following up on that on a scale of zero to 10, zero being not confident at all. ; Therapist: 10 being extremely confident. ; Therapist: How confident are you that if you decided to take a break from relationship with Kelly, you would be successful at making that happen? ; Patient: Oh, I don't know, maybe like a three or four. ; Therapist: Okay, so so less confident, a little less confident than you are motivated. ; Therapist: Why a three and not a zero? ; Patient: Because I, I want it. ; Patient: I mean, I do. ; Patient: It's something I want. ; Therapist: And so wanting it makes you feel confident that you confident to some extent that you could actually make it happen. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Why Why three and not an eight or a nine? ; Patient: I can't control her. ; Patient: I don't know how she would react. ; Patient: And I just don't want any more arguments and anger. ; Patient: And yeah, and I don't want to hurt her. ; Patient: So. ; Therapist: So when you think about taking this break, you're also thinking about how she might respond and what she might do. ; Therapist: And that creates this whole other kind of set of worries. ; Therapist: And it undermines your sense of confidence on some level. ; Patient: It creates a lot of anxiety for me. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: What do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break? ; Patient: I think I like maybe a plan, like just knowing, knowing what the rules are sort of like where, where, where I want to go with it and what I'm, I don't know what I want to accomplish. ; Therapist: So thinking through an actual plan, like what you would say, how long, what the boundaries are, might, might help you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: In that regard. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And then one final question on a scale of zero to 10, zero being not ready at all and 10 being extremely ready. ; Therapist: How ready would you say you are to commit to taking some kind of brief break in the, let's say the next couple of weeks? ; Patient: I think an eight. ; Therapist: An eight? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, so pretty ready. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And, and you've spoken to this already a little bit, I believe, but I'll ask you again, why an eight and not a one or a two? ; Patient: Because I know if I just let it drag out, that I'm going to be miserable. ; Therapist: So your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your motivation. ; Therapist: That is that this is something you know that you need to do for yourself. ; Therapist: And if you don't, things are not going to get any better. ; Therapist: And that, that makes you both motivated and even more ready. ; Therapist: Well, why, why an eight and not a 10? ; Patient: That's, you know, scary. ; Patient: Change is hard. ; Patient: And thinking about not being with a woman, I thought I was going to marry. ; Patient: It's sad, makes me sad. ; Therapist: So ; Therapist: your emotions, your sense of maybe sadness and, and grief and disappointment around this detract from your sense of readiness in some way. ; Patient: Sort of giving up on a dream. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And so another aspect then to your whole experience is that you're, you're grieving. ; Therapist: The relationship isn't even over yet, but you're grieving the dream and the hopes that you had. ; Therapist: And that's a, that's a heaviness and certainly a factor in, in what you do next. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, if I could take just a moment and make sure I've captured and understood everything you've shared with me. ; Therapist: And I, I know this is really difficult to talk about. ; Therapist: So I really appreciate you spending the time to share with me what, what this has been like for you. ; Therapist: You've been feeling stuck and things were great for a while. ; Therapist: You had some hope that things were going to change. ; Therapist: And now you realizing that Kelly is not going to change and that you were suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspirations and your dreams in a lot of different regards. ; Therapist: You know that you need to make a change. ; Therapist: You want to make a change. ; Therapist: And you have a lot of mixed feelings about this change. ; Therapist: You know, it's what you want to do. ; Therapist: It's the right thing for you. ; Therapist: And you still really care and love Kelly. ; Therapist: And you're also concerned kind of on an outer level about your business, about your community, about your family and your friends and how they may be affected by a breakup. ; Therapist: In order to make this more manageable, you're thinking maybe in terms of smaller change, like taking a small break as opposed to breaking off the relationship. ; Therapist: And you feel like you're pretty ready. ; Therapist: You're somewhat, you know, you're motivated and it may be a little less confident, but you also said that if you were able to maybe think through a concrete plan that that might help you feel more confident. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that's certainly something that we could do together next time we meet. ; Therapist: If that's all right with you, I'd be happy to hear your ideas, maybe even share some suggestions with you about a possible plan. ; Patient: That'd be great. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Thank you very much for your time Liv. ; Therapist: I really appreciate it.",

; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothering you. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about those? ; Patient: I'm worried all the time. ; Patient: Just every day, all day, just so worried about everything. ; Patient: I've just started back to school after 20 years. ; Patient: I've been a housewife. ; Patient: The kids are now grown, so why not go back to school? ; Patient: Now, for the past seven, eight months, it's just been nothing but worry, worry, worry, constantly all the time. ; Patient: I'm worried about home, worried about school, and it's affecting my life. ; Therapist: All right, so a lot of worrying. ; Therapist: How many days would you say you worry in a typical week? ; Patient: How many days don't I worry? ; Patient: I'd say most days, Monday through Friday, Saturday, it's just always worrying. ; Patient: On Monday through Friday, I'm worried about school, or when I'm at school, I'm worried about home. ; Patient: Then on the weekends, I know the school week's coming up, and then I'm just worried about managing everything. ; Patient: How am I going to deal with everything? ; Patient: I would say it's a lot. ; Therapist: It's very distressing for you. ; Patient: Very much so. ; Therapist: You mentioned it's impacting school. ; Patient: Well, in school, I'm not doing too well right now. ; Patient: When I was an undergrad, I used to be a straight-A student. ; Patient: I thought I could do it again, just pick up where I left off, but right now, I'm worried so much that I'm so focused on worrying that I'm worried about what assignments to do, worried about, do I have this turned in, that my grades are slipping right now. ; Patient: When I'm in school, I'm so worried about home, what's going on at home, that I can't pay attention in class. ; Patient: It's just all-consuming. ; Therapist: All right, so both at school and at home. ; Patient: Oh, yes, definitely. ; Therapist: You find it difficult to control the anxiety? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's affecting in a major way. ; Patient: Yes, very much so. ; Therapist: Let me ask you some other questions that may be tied in with this. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you use any alcohol or drugs? ; Patient: Some. ; Therapist: Some? ; Patient: Some. ; Patient: I have a drink occasionally, but I'm so worried right now. ; Patient: My nerves are always on edge right now that I find it helps. ; Patient: I got under control. ; Therapist: It's under control? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: How often would you say you drink? ; Patient: Maybe some here and there every day. ; Therapist: How much would you say you drink? ; Patient: Maybe a few glistens of wine a night, but I'm not an alcoholic or anything. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How about the drug use? ; Patient: A little pot, but I find it helps my nerves. ; Therapist: Just now and then? ; Patient: Maybe a couple times a week. ; Therapist: A couple times a week. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a panic attack? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Have you ever had any trauma in your history? ; Patient: Well, my grandma, she died when I was young. ; Patient: She used to take care of us. ; Patient: She was like a second mom to me, and I saw her that way. ; Patient: She died when I was young, and she was real young. ; Patient: I was really close to her. ; Patient: I think about her a lot now, especially since I have started back in school. ; Patient: She's always encouraged me, get your education, get it while you can. ; Patient: Now I've been thinking about her a lot. ; Therapist: She's been on your mind. ; Therapist: When you think about her, what's the feeling that comes up? ; Patient: I worry a lot about her, because I'm thinking that I'm upsetting her and her memory. ; Patient: That if I don't do well, then she will be upset. ; Patient: Even though I know she's not here anymore, she'll be upset if I'm not doing well. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: When you're thinking about her, you're having some worry? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's been distressing you? ; Patient: Very much, yes. ; Therapist: I'm going to ask you some different symptoms. ; Therapist: Let me know if you have these symptoms as part of what's going on now. ; Therapist: Do you feel restless, keyed up, or on edge? ; Patient: All the time. ; Patient: Just so tense. ; Therapist: How about you feel like you get tired easily? ; Patient: I'm tired all the time. ; Therapist: All the time? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: How about, do you find your mind going blank or having trouble concentrating? ; Patient: I find I'm trying to think of so many things at once, so I can't focus just on one thing. ; Patient: Yes, definitely having trouble concentrating. ; Therapist: Trouble concentrating. ; Therapist: Have you noticed that you're more irritable? ; Patient: I'm not sleeping a lot, so I'm cranky. ; Therapist: Cranky? ; Patient: I was going to say, according to my husband, a lot irritable. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You mentioned you're tense all the time. ; Therapist: Is that like a muscle tension? ; Patient: Pretty much so. ; Patient: I feel like my muscles are going to snap. ; Patient: I feel so rigid all the time. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Tell me about your sleep. ; Patient: Sleep's been... what's sleep? ; Patient: It's just like non-existent pretty much right now. ; Patient: I just think trying to go to sleep when you have so much on your mind is hard. ; Therapist: So you have difficulty falling asleep? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: How about once you fall asleep, do you stay asleep? ; Patient: No, because I find like even I'll have nightmares that will just wake me up, and then I just find myself, when I get up, oh my gosh, what do I have to do? ; Patient: What am I forgetting? ; Patient: So I just always feel like there's something always on my mind that just makes it, if I'm asleep, I can't stay asleep because I wake up thinking about it, and I can't go back to sleep. ; Patient: It's just some ugly cycle going on right now. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: All right, so sleep has been a big problem for you. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Sarah, I'd like to get you in to see a counselor. ; Therapist: I can probably get you in to see one in just a couple days if that's okay. ; Patient: Oh, I would appreciate that. ; Therapist: That'd be helpful. ; Patient: Yes, yes. ; Therapist: I want to thank you for answering these questions for me. ; Therapist: This has been really helpful. ; Patient: No, thank you very much. ; Therapist: Thanks, Sarah.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: So Bethany, can you tell me what this week has looked like for you? ; Patient: This week? ; Patient: Um, I don't know, I guess it was a little bit more productive than usual, but not really. ; Patient: I'm still just usual. ; Patient: I'm dead to the world. ; Therapist: Dead to the world? ; Patient: Yeah, you know, I'm just in my room most of the day. ; Patient: I'm not really part of the world or part of my family. ; Patient: I'm just closed off in my own little sad universe, I guess. ; Therapist: So you're feeling isolated from your family? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm just feeling really disconnected. ; Patient: Just really... ; Patient: I don't know, it's just been a really tough week with my husband. ; Patient: We've been fighting a lot, as usual. ; Therapist: So when you say you're feeling disconnected, can you explain to me more what that looks like? ; Patient: Yeah, I guess I'm just so tired all day. ; Patient: I'm just exhausted. ; Patient: He has all these demands and all these things he wants me to do, and I just feel like I'm not capable of doing that. ; Patient: I can't even get myself out of bed. ; Patient: I'm wondering how am I supposed to do all the things he wants me to do. ; Patient: Just last night, he came home at me like usual, and all the dishes were still in the sink, and all the laundry was all in the bed. ; Patient: I couldn't even tell him that I looked online for jobs, which I thought I should be proud of, but I didn't even find a job. ; Patient: So whatever, it's not even that big of a deal. ; Patient: I just thought maybe we could talk about that, but he was just feeling that his shirts need to be ironed, and I just couldn't do any of it. ; Therapist: So you feel that even though you made some progress by looking at them for jobs this week, that you didn't feel much accomplishment from that because your husband didn't acknowledge it or appreciate it. ; Patient: Yeah, he doesn't appreciate anything I do. ; Therapist: How does being unappreciated make you feel inside? ; Patient: It just makes my whole body ache. ; Patient: It just makes me feel empty. ; Patient: If he can't appreciate the things that I do, then why would I be motivated to do the things that he wants me to do? ; Patient: How am I supposed to iron his shirts when I can't even get out of bed in the morning? ; Patient: It just makes me feel really just empty, just miserable. ; Therapist: I hear you saying that you're shutting down, and not only do I hear you saying that, I can see you sitting here with me, with the way you're sitting with your honest cross. ; Therapist: I feel like you're closing yourself off to a lot of things, to a lot of people. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely I am because they don't notice anything I do. ; Patient: On Monday, I actually got out of the house, which I thought was a big deal in the moment, but I took the cat to the groomer. ; Patient: My husband's been bugging me about that for months. ; Patient: I got out of the house, I drove the groomers, I changed in my pajamas. ; Patient: All these things are a big deal to me, but he doesn't even see that as an accomplishment. ; Patient: They didn't even notice. ; Patient: My daughter didn't notice either. ; Patient: She just comes home and slams the door, doesn't even look at me. ; Patient: The cat was all groomed, had a nice little bow, and I haven't even spent five days since then. ; Patient: No one's even said anything since then. ; Therapist: So I feel like I've made this huge accomplishment for myself by getting out of the door, even, and taking the cat to the groomers. ; Therapist: But then when I get home and it's not noticed by anyone, it takes it all away. ; Therapist: It doesn't even matter to me. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: So for things to matter to you, and for you to feel good about the even little steps you're making, you really need to have that acknowledged by your husband and your daughter. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, otherwise what's the point? ; Patient: You know, if they don't have that support, all they do is point out the things I haven't done. ; Patient: They'll do something that it's all about what hasn't been done. ; Patient: Oh, you haven't vacuumed in two months. ; Patient: But they don't notice the things that I actually do. ; Therapist: So I feel, I hear you saying that you're experiencing a lot of hurt. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So Bethany, you're feeling all this hurt. ; Therapist: You're feeling, like, nobody's recognizing who you are. ; Therapist: You have all this laundry, vacuuming to do, all these chores. ; Therapist: It's a lot. ; Therapist: Do you think it's a way for me to put it away somewhere for a little bit, to be able to address other issues? ; Patient: I could try. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you trust me to put it in a little jar and be able to put all that hurt in a little jar? ; Patient: It's hard. ; Patient: It feels like there's so much of it in a little bit. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you need a bigger space maybe for it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright, let's try putting it in the corner over here. ; Therapist: Let's try one more time. ; Patient: It's hard. ; Patient: It's like it won't disconnect from me. ; Patient: I just can't separate it from myself. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What do you think that hurts trying to tell you? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: Let's take a minute and think about it. ; Therapist: We need something. ; Patient: Maybe it's just telling me that it's what I always do. ; Patient: I always try to avoid it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, let's tell the hurt that the hurt is important. ; Therapist: We'll be able to come back to it once you push it away. ; Therapist: So it's not going to be there forever. ; Therapist: So can we do that? ; Patient: I guess we could try. ; Patient: I just know it's trying to tell me that it's not going to work. ; Patient: It's just, yeah, I feel like it's just what I always do with it. ; Patient: I always just try to avoid it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright, well, let's try doing this. ; Therapist: Let's try closing your eyes. ; Therapist: We'll do some breathing exercises here. ; Therapist: Take a deep breath in. ; Therapist: Deep breath out. ; Therapist: Deep breath in. ; Therapist: Deep breath out. ; Therapist: Imagine all the laundry, the husband, the daughter, the cat. ; Therapist: Let's put it outside in the hallway, the very bottom of the hallway. ; Therapist: Breathe in. ; Therapist: Breathe out. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Open your eyes. ; Therapist: How does that feel? ; Patient: I guess I'm feeling a little bit more relaxed, but I still don't feel good. ; Therapist: Is it in the hallway or are you still hanging on to it? ; Patient: I guess it's in the hallway now, just different things kind of coming up. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what are you feeling? ; Therapist: What do you want to talk about? ; Patient: Oh, no, I guess I'm kind of lost. ; Patient: What should I talk about? ; Therapist: I don't have an agenda today. ; Therapist: So whatever comes to mind, whatever you feel is important. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Do you have any suggestions? ; Therapist: We'll take a minute. ; Therapist: We'll think about it. ; Therapist: Close your eyes again. ; Therapist: Think about what you're feeling. ; Therapist: So what are you feeling right now? ; Patient: I guess what it really is is I feel guilty for even letting go of that hurt. ; Patient: Like I need that hurt or that hurt makes me feel guilty. ; Patient: Like I shouldn't be hurting. ; Patient: Like part of me needs the hurt and part of me just feels so bad for even hurting that I should be taking it on my own. ; Patient: I just feel a lot of guilt. ; Therapist: So you feel guilty and you hurt. ; Therapist: I'm not worthy of feeling hurt. ; Therapist: I'm not worthy of feeling good. ; Patient: Yeah, exactly. ; Patient: It's like I feel guilty for even feeling hurt. ; Patient: But I feel guilty for feeling good. ; Patient: It's like I don't deserve happiness, but I know I probably deserve to feel better. ; Patient: It's just no matter what, I just feel guilty. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So I want to kind of delve into that a little bit. ; Therapist: That guilt that you're feeling that's arising into this hurt. ; Therapist: Are you going to be willing to try something with me? ; Patient: Yeah, sure. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what I'm going to do is I want you to think about this chair. ; Therapist: I want you to picture yourself over here. ; Therapist: This is the side of you that says you don't deserve to be able to feel guilty and that you don't deserve to be hurt. ; Therapist: So I want you to focus on yourself. ; Therapist: Tell yourself about how it makes you feel to be guilty. ; Patient: I just feel like I feel guilty for hurting because it forces me to just stay in bed. ; Patient: And it makes me feel hurt. ; Patient: It makes me feel like I'm incapable of taking care of my family. ; Patient: I need to take care of my family. ; Patient: I just feel guilty because I'm hurting. ; Patient: I can't do that. ; Patient: I can't be there for them. ; Therapist: I closed down when I'm hurt. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And I deserve more than being hurt. ; Therapist: And you deserve more than being hurt. ; Patient: I deserve more than being hurt. ; Therapist: And you want to be there for your family. ; Patient: I want to be there for my family. ; Therapist: Do you want to share? ; Patient: I want to share. ; Therapist: You don't deserve to be... feel guilty about being hurt. ; Patient: You don't deserve to feel guilty about being hurt. ; Therapist: You need to take care of your family and stop being so selfish. ; Patient: You need to stop being so selfish. ; Patient: Your family needs you. ; Patient: You've got to take care of them. ; Therapist: And when you don't take care of them, they get upset. ; Patient: That's why they're always mad at you. ; Patient: Because you don't take care of them. ; Patient: You're selfish. ; Patient: I'm not going to go back there. ; Therapist: How does it make you feel when yourself tells you that you're selfish? ; Patient: It hurts. ; Patient: It's really sad. ; Patient: I'm sad. ; Therapist: It makes me... it hurts me more. ; Patient: It hurts me when you tell me I'm selfish. ; Patient: When you tell me I'm not there for my family or I don't care about things. ; Patient: I do care about them so much. ; Patient: I'm trying my best. ; Therapist: Why are you making me feel guilty about being hurt? ; Therapist: I... I have needs too. ; Patient: I have needs I need to be taken care of too. ; Patient: I can't help being hurt. ; Therapist: And you're not taking care of me. ; Therapist: You're not allowing me to feel good. ; Patient: You're not allowing me to feel good. ; Patient: I'm feeling selfish and doesn't allow me to feel good. ; Patient: I can't even be there for my family. ; Patient: I can't even feel good. ; Therapist: How does it feel when you hear that you're hurt... that... that hurts and the pain that you're feeling? ; Patient: It just feels like I need to... I need to step it up and I need to try even harder. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So when you tell yourself that I'm hurt and then you tell yourself I'm selfish, how does that feel inside? ; Patient: It's just really confusing. ; Patient: It's like I need to break out of this guilty feeling and just allow myself to hurt. ; Therapist: I deserve to hurt. ; Therapist: I need to hurt sometimes. ; Therapist: And it's okay. ; Patient: I need to hurt sometimes and that's okay. ; Therapist: I deserve to have my needs met as well. ; Patient: I deserve to have my needs met as well. ; Therapist: So how does it make you feel that your other self understands that you're hurt? ; Patient: Actually it does. ; Patient: I mean it's still hurting but it's on my side. ; Patient: It's okay to hurt now. ; Therapist: I feel better that you're allowing me to hurt. ; Patient: I feel better that you're allowing me to hurt. ; Therapist: I feel validated. ; Patient: I feel validated. ; Therapist: I need to help my family. ; Patient: I need to help my family. ; Patient: I need to hurt and show them that I'm hurting but not feel guilty about it. ; Patient: That way I can be there for them and they can really understand what's going on with them. ; Therapist: I need you. ; Therapist: I need things too. ; Patient: Yeah, I need things too. ; Patient: I have needs too. ; Therapist: So how do you feel inside right now? ; Patient: I almost feel things feel lighter like some of that guilt is gone. ; Patient: Even I'm still really hurt and I feel really sad but it just feels more okay to feel that way. ; Therapist: When you hear that you need things and it's okay to be hurt and I need to be validated, tell yourself how you can maybe do that. ; Therapist: Can you allow it? ; Patient: Yeah, I think I can allow that. ; Patient: I can feel hurt without feeling guilty. ; Patient: I can feel okay about hurting. ; Patient: I can talk about hurting without feeling guilty about it. ; Patient: It's okay to hurt. ; Therapist: And it doesn't make me selfish to be things. ; Patient: Yeah, it doesn't make me selfish to be things. ; Therapist: So now you can come to an agreement with yourself to allow that space to hurt without the guilt? ; Patient: Yeah, well that's sad. ; Therapist: So we're actually out of time for today. ; Therapist: So I want you to take this awareness with you this week and then we'll kick up again next week.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hello, Liz. ; Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm okay. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well. ; Therapist: Thanks for asking. ; Therapist: How have things been going? ; Patient: They've been all right. ; Therapist: Last time we were talking, it sounded like you were still having some difficulty with the quizzes. ; Therapist: Is that still the case? ; Patient: Yeah, it's still panic when I take them. ; Therapist: You're still in panic? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about the process of taking the quizzes? ; Therapist: I know we've touched on this a little bit before. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: So I'm going to class. ; Patient: I'm fine. ; Patient: I sit down to take the test. ; Patient: I'm fine. ; Patient: The test is in front of me. ; Patient: Question one, I'm not going to get that answer. ; Therapist: So you're looking down. ; Therapist: So you take these quizzes in class? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Like a paper pencil? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: With other students around? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Is having other students around distracting to you? ; Patient: No, it's happened in previous online classes. ; Patient: It's the same. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you're pretty sure it's the quiz itself and not some external? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it's paper and pencil. ; Therapist: You're seated. ; Therapist: You're in the room. ; Therapist: The room's relatively distraction-free? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, everybody's quiet. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And you're looking down at, really, the first item on the quiz. ; Therapist: And what's happening then as you look down and you read that first item? ; Therapist: What's happening at a thought level? ; Therapist: We'll start at a thought level. ; Therapist: What's happening? ; Therapist: What are you thinking? ; Patient: I'm thinking, I'm reading the question and I'm thinking, oh my God, there's four. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: So it's got to be one of them. ; Patient: And I am not going to pick the right one. ; Patient: I'm going to think I picked the right one. ; Patient: And it's going to be the one of my second choices. ; Patient: And I am not going to pick the right one. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So your thought is that you're going to select the wrong response and therefore get that quiz item wrong. ; Therapist: How about behavior? ; Therapist: Like, do you notice anything physically going on as you're thinking about that quiz item and how you're going to get it wrong? ; Patient: I'd say my palms are probably sweaty. ; Patient: Like, probably a little tense. ; Therapist: A little tense? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: That's really it. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So what it could be is that this thought of, I'm going to get this item wrong, is leading to these uncomfortable feelings, the physical feelings. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So what happens when you answer item one? ; Therapist: Like, you don't know if you have it right or wrong immediately, right? ; Therapist: Because it's a paper and pencil. ; Therapist: So you answer item one and you move on to item two. ; Therapist: What happens then? ; Patient: It starts all over again. ; Patient: I'm already like, well, I already got the first one wrong and now I'm, my chances are higher of getting this one wrong. ; Therapist: So you feel like it because you thought that you got the first one wrong, that your chances of getting the second one wrong actually increase. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I feel like I got one wrong the whole test. ; Patient: It's all going to be wrong. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a quiz that you've taken where you were confident that you got the first item, right? ; Patient: I'm sure I have. ; Patient: I can't remember any. ; Therapist: But eventually you're going to come to one item that you're going to have these doubts about. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Inevitably it happens. ; Therapist: There's going to be one that's maybe a little more difficult or difficult for you. ; Therapist: So it seems like what you're saying is that when you reach that item where you have that thought, from that point on, the next item is more difficult because you're having a similar thought. ; Therapist: Does that pattern continue? ; Patient: Throughout the test, ; Patient: yes. ; Therapist: So explain to me what, like let's just go with the example of the first item, like just to keep it more simple. ; Therapist: So you have the first item and that didn't work out for you, that thought, right? ; Therapist: The second one you thought was, I have even a greater chance of missing. ; Therapist: So what happens after you respond to that second item? ; Patient: It just compounds. ; Patient: I just start, I feel worse and worse as the quiz, as I continue. ; Therapist: That's awful. ; Therapist: So it's an awful feeling for you, right? ; Therapist: So by the time you get to item five or six. ; Patient: I'm convinced it's over. ; Patient: I've gotten a zero. ; Patient: If it's the first, I've gotten a zero. ; Patient: I've gotten a bad grade. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So that's what's on your mind. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how about those physical symptoms? ; Therapist: Are they the same, different, are there new symptoms? ; Patient: If it like, if it's, if it like starts early at the beginning of the test, my heart's like pounding at this point, but I still have a sweaty palms. ; Patient: I'm still like tensing. ; Therapist: So it really just gets mentally and physically more unpleasant for you the whole time. ; Therapist: So when you just, when you're saying panic, the panic's really occurring a few items in after you have the first one that you thought you missed. ; Therapist: And this has been happening for a while as you described, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, how about your grades? ; Therapist: How have you actually been doing on the quizzes? ; Patient: I've been a pretty solid B student. ; Patient: So, and I feel, I wish I did better. ; Patient: I wish I got A's, but I mean, these are fine. ; Patient: But when I take those quizzes, it's not, it doesn't, I don't know how it translates. ; Therapist: How about your study habits? ; Therapist: You consider yourself effective at studying? ; Patient: I've tried, I've taken workshops on studying. ; Patient: I've, I, I think I'm pretty effective at studying. ; Patient: I've found what doesn't work. ; Patient: So I try to study by reading the chapters, taking outlines, reviewing flashcards, which has, I think the best results, but. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So your study habits are good and your quiz scores are good. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But you're still having these distressing thoughts and these uncomfortable physical sensations when you take the quizzes. ; Therapist: Is that about right? ; Patient: Yeah, that's absolutely right. ; Therapist: So really, you don't necessarily need your performance to change. ; Therapist: You just, you just need your, your thoughts and feelings and behaviors to change. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So how you, how you're reacting to the quizzes, maybe. ; Patient: Yeah, because I get B's, like I said. ; Patient: So yeah. ; Therapist: And B is good. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, all right. ; Therapist: So I want to take you back to the moment when you're looking at the first item. ; Therapist: Let's go back to that for a second. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you're taking a quiz and you're having those thoughts surrounding that first item, which I'm not mistaken, the automatic thought. ; Therapist: We talked about this, right, with the cognitive behavioral therapy. ; Therapist: The automatic thought is that I'm, I'm not going to get this one right or something to that effect. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: What does that mean to you? ; Patient: It means once I don't get that right, I'm not going to get anything else right. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So what that thought means to you is that you're going to miss that item and then you're going to miss all the rest of the items. ; Therapist: So you're, you're going to fail the whole quiz. ; Patient: The whole thing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So looking at that, let's, let's call that an intermediate belief, right? ; Therapist: It's more of a rule or an expectation, right? ; Therapist: What does that mean to you? ; Patient: It just gets worse if I fail the quiz, then I'm like, Oh my God, I'm going to fail the final. ; Patient: I'm going to fail the course. ; Patient: And that's going to affect my GPA. ; Therapist: So it just keeps stacking, right? ; Therapist: So we have other, other beliefs. ; Therapist: So you're going to fail the course and, or you're going to fail the final rather than you're going to fail the course. ; Therapist: So if you failed the course, what would that mean to you? ; Patient: That I'm not going to graduate. ; Therapist: You're not going to graduate. ; Therapist: So we've moved from failing the quiz. ; Therapist: If we just look at the meaning, right, to fail on the final, to fail on the course, and now to not graduating. ; Therapist: So if you didn't graduate, what would that mean to you? ; Patient: I can't, I can't be a teacher. ; Patient: I can't do what I want to do. ; Therapist: So your chosen vocation to be a teacher would be not possible. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So we go a step further and say, what would it mean to you if you couldn't be a teacher? ; Patient: I don't know who I'd be at that point. ; Patient: That's what I always saw as my career. ; Patient: So I don't know what my future would look like at that point without that. ; Therapist: So if you were to phrase it and kind of, I think back as we, to the CBT techniques and the kind of conceptualization we've covered, if you were to phrase that as an I am statement, right, what would you, what would you be if you couldn't be a teacher? ; Therapist: What would that make you? ; Patient: I am a person who didn't make it. ; Patient: I'm a person that failed, like we said earlier. ; Therapist: I'm a person that didn't make it. ; Therapist: I'm a person who failed. ; Therapist: So in a way you're saying I'm a failure. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You know, is that, is that close? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So remember we talked before about core beliefs. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And how these core beliefs drive these intermediate beliefs, which combine with situations like in your case taking a quiz to form these automatic thoughts. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So one of your core beliefs may be that you're a failure. ; Therapist: You may believe that. ; Therapist: Does that seem like something that you've said to yourself before or thought before? ; Patient: I didn't think about it like that until we did the step up to it now, but I, I can relate to that. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Because a lot of times I do feel like, oh, I'm not gonna be able to do this. ; Patient: Because it's me, I won't be able to do it. ; Therapist: Not because it's challenging or difficult, but something to do with you. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So that's where kind of like the, you're personalizing. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So you're saying to yourself at a variety of levels, I'm gonna be unsuccessful, I'm gonna fail. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you think that's what's happening? ; Patient: It must be. ; Patient: Because like I said, I study. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: I get good grades. ; Patient: I've been tested years ago. ; Patient: I don't have ADHD, anything intrinsic that would prohibit me. ; Therapist: So you're able to focus and concentrate well? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: I can do all of that, but when it comes to it, I'm like, I can't do it. ; Therapist: So somewhere, somewhere is this core belief. ; Therapist: And it's possible that it has something to do with you believing that you are a failure, unsuccessful. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: How do you think your, say, friends or family would interpret that? ; Therapist: Like if, and I'm not suggesting telling them that, but if they were to somehow know that, that you believed you were a failure, how would they react? ; Patient: I don't think they would see the connection. ; Patient: I don't, I think they would be like, well, you do well in school, I don't understand. ; Therapist: So they wouldn't believe that you're a failure? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: You may believe it. ; Patient: Yeah, I, yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And similarly, if you had a classmate that was in the same situation, and you know, struggled with these disturbing thoughts and feelings and behaviors during quizzes, how would you evaluate them? ; Patient: I guess I'd say the same thing that my family would say, like, you're, look at the evidence, you're not a failure. ; Therapist: You'd say, look at the evidence. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you'd, you'd evaluate that they weren't a failure. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But with yourself, you're being a little more harsh. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Which isn't uncommon. ; Therapist: So there's a few levels at which I think we can go after this, what I'll call a problem. ; Therapist: But really, it's a series of thoughts and beliefs. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: The first is that the comic at the ground level. ; Therapist: And that's when you are taking the quiz, and you have that automatic thought that says, I'm, I'm going to miss this item. ; Patient: I'm not gonna get it right. ; Therapist: Yeah, I'm not gonna get it right. ; Therapist: That's your thought. ; Therapist: I'm not gonna get it right. ; Therapist: In these situations, I like to encourage clients to apply what's called an adaptive response or self talk. ; Therapist: So it's a, now if you're in a quiz in a quiet classroom, it wouldn't literally be self-taught. ; Patient: Right, right. ; Therapist: But it's a thought that you're consciously applying. ; Therapist: So the other thought, that's automatic. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: That just pops in your head, right? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: This one would be one that you deliberately think. ; Patient: I make myself. ; Therapist: So what could you think to yourself that would be a counter to that automatic thought that you're having, that you're gonna get that item wrong? ; Patient: I guess that in my past quizzes, like, chances are, I have a good chance of getting it right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So just looking at the probabilities based on your past performance, even though I'm thinking I'm going to get it wrong. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Chances are, I'm gonna get it right. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Somehow I still have a B. So. ; Therapist: So you are getting most of them, right? ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: So I have a good chance. ; Therapist: So I like that adaptive response, right? ; Therapist: Do you think that makes sense for you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I think you did well there. ; Therapist: So the next time you're taking a quiz, I want you to apply that adaptive response. ; Therapist: Now this takes work, right? ; Therapist: So this automatic thought's gonna come upon you, and before you know it, you're gonna have that feeling. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: The physical symptoms you discussed, the sweaty palms, right? ; Therapist: And the feeling of, I think you mentioned, tense. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So don't let it discourage you. ; Therapist: Those symptoms come on so quickly. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: There is an intervening thought, and you've identified it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you will have an opportunity, most likely, to apply that automatic thought at some point. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But the first few times it might be, might be a little rough. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Doesn't count. ; Therapist: I guess the nice thing about a quiz is, I mean, how many items are on these quizzes? ; Patient: Yeah, like 15. ; Therapist: 15 ; Therapist: So you have a few different chances to apply that ; Therapist: adaptive response. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: It's more than one. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, you know, you would like to get, on the first time, where you have the automatic thought, where you identify the automatic thought, but if you don't, it's not a big deal. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: So, you know, later on, maybe it takes item two or three, and then you might remember, hey, I have this. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Oh, wait. ; Patient: I'm supposed to be thinking this. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And my hope is that as you apply this adaptive response more and more, you can reduce the probability that that automatic thought's going to come in. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So that's one level that I want you to go after it. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: It does. ; Patient: I think I can do that. ; Therapist: That's something you feel like you could do? ; Patient: It is. ; Therapist: At the other level, I guess you'd call this a deeper level, but it's all really, you know, in your brain. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: It's this core belief. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And why I use the word deeper is because we think of core beliefs as more stubborn, like they don't change as easily. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: As automatic thoughts might. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I'd like you to, and this is really just more reflection, reflect on the evidence or evaluate the evidence that supports and refutes this idea that you are unsuccessful, that you're a failure. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: I think cognitively you kind of understand that you're not. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: But in another sense, you feel like you are. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: So in a way, cognitively, you're... ; Patient: There's that discrepancy. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: There's a little bit of both. ; Therapist: You know, ; Therapist: you can tell me that your family would say that's not the case, but you still... ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: On paper, technically, I would, I'm not, but I still, I guess, feel that way. ; Therapist: There's a part of you that still feels that way. ; Therapist: There's a part of you that still believes that cognitively. ; Therapist: There's also a part of you that thinks through that and says that's not accurate. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So I want you to weigh the validity of that core belief. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: And actually, I think what this is helpful to write down evidence that would support it. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: And that's certainly something to note, but also, and this is really more important, evidence that refutes it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: Evidence that runs counter. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But record both, and we'll meet next time, and we'll look at the evidence. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we'll evaluate it. ; Patient: Yeah, we can do that. ; Therapist: So there's two steps you feel like you're comfortable with, and they make sense to you. ; Therapist: They make sense to you? ; Patient: Yeah, they do. ; Patient: They do. ; Patient: I definitely think I can do those. ; Therapist: When's the next time you'll be taking a quiz? ; Patient: I think next week. ; Therapist: Next week. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You have these quizzes often. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So we'll set up a session for next week. ; Therapist: Let's try to get to where it's after your next quiz. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So we'll have that to talk about, because I think that's the next area to make, it sounds like the next area would be good to try to make progress on. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I mean, it seems like that's what you want to work on. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So we'll go from there. ; Therapist: So I'll set you up an appointment for just after that quiz, try the adaptive response. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And try ; Therapist: evaluating evidence with the core belief. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Does that sound good? ; Patient: I can do that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: I also have the appointment up, and I appreciate you coming in and working through this. ; Patient: Yeah, thank you so much.",

; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: For about the last six months or so, I have this position at work where I have to make a weekly presentation to other managers, about ten people. ; Patient: And every time I have to do this, I lose it. ; Therapist: You lose it every time you have to make a presentation? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Tell me what is involved with losing it. ; Patient: I'm usually one of the last people to go. ; Patient: And I just keep feeling more and more and more and more nervous. ; Patient: It starts where I feel like butterflies in my stomach. ; Patient: And that just becomes more intense. ; Patient: I start to just sweat all over. ; Patient: I feel like my face is turning red. ; Patient: My palms get really, really sweaty and I constantly wipe them on my pants. ; Patient: And my heart, it just feels like it's going to just beep right out of my chest. ; Patient: And I just can't. ; Patient: I can't. ; Therapist: It's very distressing. ; Therapist: So tell me about the nature of this meeting that's leading to this anxiety. ; Therapist: So you said it was a, you had to make a presentation. ; Therapist: Tell me about the structure of it. ; Patient: So there's about ten people, the executive director and then the managers of different programs. ; Patient: And we all have to do just kind of like a weekly update report. ; Patient: So none of it's very detailed. ; Patient: So maybe a few minutes each person to go around and just update everybody else on what's going on in all the different programs. ; Patient: And we all take turns. ; Therapist: How long do you have to speak? ; Patient: Usually just a few minutes, maybe five, at most ten, unless there's something major going on in my program. ; Therapist: And when, in the course of like with this meeting occurring, when do you start to feel nervous? ; Patient: Oh, the day before. ; Therapist: The day before? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So ; Therapist: the day before the meeting you start to have similar symptoms, different symptoms? ; Therapist: What do you feel? ; Patient: Yeah, I start to feel nervous. ; Patient: Usually the day before is when I'm pulling together my notes. ; Patient: I make like a few bullet points on stuff that I want to present that I think is relevant. ; Patient: And so the day before when I'm preparing that I start to feel nervous. ; Patient: And then it usually lasts through the rest of the day into the evening. ; Patient: I usually don't sleep well that night. ; Patient: And then by the time I get into work, I'm, you know, that's usually when I'm, you know, feeling, you know, really nervous. ; Patient: But by the time I get into the meeting I'm pretty much panicking. ; Therapist: All right, panicking ; Therapist: As the meeting's starting? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So at the meeting everybody takes a turn and does this brief presentation. ; Therapist: And tell me what's happening as with your feelings as they're moving around, is it a table or? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: As they're moving around the table and coming closer to you. ; Patient: I'm just becoming more and more terrified. ; Patient: I feel like I'm being just drenched in sweat. ; Patient: I'm breathing faster and I feel like everybody notices. ; Patient: I feel like everybody can hear me breathe. ; Patient: I feel like everybody can hear my heart beating. ; Patient: That it's just so loud that it's like any minute everybody's gonna look at me and say, what is wrong with you? ; Therapist: They're gonna notice you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And there have been times, especially recently really, you know, it's like I said, I mean this has been going on for at least six months, but especially recently I feel like I've had to like run out of the room. ; Patient: I couldn't take it. ; Therapist: Have you run out of the room? ; Patient: Yes, I have. ; Patient: I ran out and couldn't go back in. ; Patient: I tried and my hands hit the doorknob to go back in the room and I walked out. ; Patient: I couldn't do it. ; Therapist: There's too much anxiety. ; Patient: Yeah, I felt okay, you know, in the hallway and then when I tried to go back in the room, it's everything just right back up again. ; Therapist: Yeah, so you would push that door open. ; Therapist: They would all be looking at you. ; Therapist: They would wonder why you left. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you just wrote out the meeting somewhere else and did anybody notice after? ; Patient: You know, after a few weeks in a row of running out, yeah, you know, my boss was like, you know, I realized you didn't make your presentation and, you know, I just I made up an excuse. ; Patient: Like I got a phone call or I didn't feel good or, you know, I stumbled through some excuse, but I feel bad because I mean this is my job and I want to do my job and I mean how I've lived with this, I feel like forever, you know, because I had a terrible time making presentations in high school. ; Patient: I had a terrible time making presentations in college and here we are again and I'm trying to be a professional and have a career and make a life and I can't because I can't perform my job. ; Patient: I want to do my job. ; Patient: I like my job. ; Therapist: This is frustrating for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have there been times where you've fled the room and then since then you haven't? ; Patient: There was one time, actually, the very first time I ran out and I didn't go back and nobody noticed and then the second time, that following week, I started to feel that way again and then two of my co-workers, two of the other managers, actually started to get into a fight. ; Patient: One of them wanted more money their program for something or other and the controller was like, no, we have no money, you can't have it, it's a non-profit, so there's no money and it was like getting really intense and I don't know what it was. ; Patient: I just, I was fine. ; Therapist: Something about that intense interaction changed how you're feeling, distracted you, something like that? ; Patient: Yeah, I guess. ; Patient: It just, I don't know, it just didn't, I felt fine, I felt normal. ; Therapist: All right, so from that meeting on, like till now, have you been able to stay in for any other meetings? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay, so you've had to leave because of the intensity of the symptoms. ; Patient: Yeah, there have been a couple times where actually I've purposely gone in late and I've said I've had car trouble and I haven't, I've just gone in late or I've actually just called in sick for the day. ; Patient: There was twice I sent somebody else in my place saying that, you know, I was sick but I mean it gets noticed. ; Therapist: Yeah, and you're, you're experiencing symptoms when you avoid that interaction in the room too, right, because you don't feel good about letting them down or? ; Patient: No, no, I want to do my job. ; Patient: I really like my job. ; Patient: I really do and I like where I work and I like the people but the thought of making these presentations every week just terrifies me and I don't want my boss to regret putting me in this position. ; Patient: I don't want to disappoint him. ; Patient: I mean I know he took a big chance, you know, putting me in this position, you know, I don't have a lot of experience doing this and there were, you know, potentially there could have been other people that were better qualified but, you know, he chose me. ; Patient: I don't want to let him down and I feel like I am every week with this meeting. ; Therapist: Right, so with this meeting really you're in a situation where if you go and attend the meeting you're gonna end up leaving it because of the anxiety. ; Therapist: If you don't attend it, you have these concerns about the performance in your jobs, you're kind of, you're kind of stuck, right?

; Therapist: In what way? ; Patient: Maybe. ; Patient: Well, it's not anything new. ; Patient: But I have a lot of trouble sleeping. ; Patient: You know, I usually, I don't go to bed early. ; Patient: You know, I might go to bed a little bit late. ; Patient: But then I wake up always really early. ; Patient: Like I'll set my alarm for like eight, but I always wake up at like five or something. ; Patient: And then I can't get back to sleep. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you're waking up earlier than you want to? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I can't get back to sleep no matter how hard I try. ; Patient: And I'm tired still during the day. ; Patient: You know, I don't have a lot of energy. ; Patient: But it doesn't matter. ; Patient: It's just it's hard for me to go to sleep. ; Patient: And it's been like that for a really long time. ; Patient: Probably since high school. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: But, you know, lately I just, I realize, you know, some days are better than others. ; Patient: But it's been a couple weeks ago that really like made me feel like I should have talked to someone. ; Therapist: What happened? ; Patient: Well, my brother got married. ; Patient: And I'm very close to him. ; Patient: And I was really looking forward to the wedding. ; Patient: And then when I went, I just, I mean, I didn't not enjoy it, but I just didn't have as much fun as I thought I would. ; Patient: And I know it's just because of, you know, my mood, like that I'm always a little gloomy. ; Patient: You know, like, so my brother says I'm like, you're, you know, so like, but I was really looking, like I, you know, I step out of my comfort zone. ; Patient: I like to try new things. ; Patient: And I was really looking forward to this one. ; Patient: I used to love, I love weddings, you know, and it's not that I don't love them now, but I thought I would enjoy it more than I did. ; Patient: And that kind of like freaked me out. ; Therapist: So your mood, your mood didn't elevate like maybe you hoped it would. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I would have thought that, I mean, I've been looking forward to this wedding for a year and a half, but you know, I've helped, you know, my now sister plan it. ; Patient: And it just wasn't as fun as I wanted it to be, or as I thought it would be, you know. ; Therapist: And realizing this is what brought you in today. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And like right afterwards, like last week, you know, it was, I had more worse days than better days. ; Patient: And I would go up early the next morning, even though I had been up late at the wedding, and just sat there and thought about it and was really just upset by the whole thing, upset that I couldn't be more happy for, you know, my brother. ; Patient: For me, really, not even for my brother. ; Patient: Because I was happy for him. ; Patient: It just didn't, I didn't feel excited like everyone else. ; Patient: Everyone else around me was having such a good time, and I was just... ; Therapist: More down. ; Patient: Yeah, like I was happier than I would be if I was staying at home by myself, but I wasn't, I wasn't like everyone else. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you mentioned that this is going on from high school? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So how long would that be? ; Patient: So I mean, I graduated in 2010, so eight years. ; Therapist: So about eight years. ; Therapist: And you've been, you've been feeling down. ; Therapist: Has the, the sleep been a problem for that long? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I, a little bit when I was in high school, I thought it was, you know, I thought it was just a quirk or something about staying up late and like hours in high school, but it never like got better. ; Patient: Even when I, you know, started working out of school and stuff, I, my sleep schedule never came to that normal eight hours a night like you're supposed to. ; Patient: I know no one's ever is, but it just never, yeah. ; Patient: So sleep's always been an issue, and I just, like I said, my brother's called me Eeyore for years just because I... ; Therapist: Yeah, you mentioned the word gloomy. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So low energy's been a problem for that long as well. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And you've been waking up earlier than you want, want to. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about, you, you, you mentioned the depressed mood. ; Therapist: You feel down. ; Therapist: Is that worse than any particular time of the day? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, it's worse than that in the morning. ; Therapist: In the morning? ; Patient: Especially when I'm just like sitting there with my thoughts, when I can't get back to sleep, it will be bad. ; Patient: And then, you know, it'll be time to get ready for the day, and I'll be angry and mad that it's, you know, that I, I can't sleep, and then depressed about, you know, that I'm like this, that I'm weird. ; Patient: And then, I mean, as the day goes on, I forget about it a little bit, and it gets a little bit better in the afternoons. ; Patient: And nighttime, I'm really like, you know, I enjoy spending time with my family for dinner and stuff like that. ; Patient: So, it gets better as the day goes on, but, you know, in the morning, it's, it's bad because I just spent hours lying there thinking about it. ; Therapist: So, morning, morning's the worst. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, I'm going to ask you some other questions related to this. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You mentioned depressed mood, and you mentioned how you reacted to the wedding, how it was and what you hoped. ; Therapist: Have you lost interest in other things that might be fun or pleasurable? ; Patient: I haven't really lost an interest in anything. ; Patient: Like, I still, you know, I still seek out fun activities, and I still participate in them. ; Patient: And, I mean, they'll make me feel better than not doing them. ; Patient: But it's just, I don't know, it's just, I don't, I guess, my response to them isn't as high as I see other people enjoying activities. ; Patient: And I don't, but I do enjoy them. ; Therapist: But it's just not as much. ; Therapist: Not as much. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Any changes to your appetite or weight? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: It stays the same. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Any feelings of restlessness or the opposite, kind of being slowed down? ; Therapist: Anything like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You ever feel a sense of worthlessness? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Something like that? ; Therapist: How about concentration? ; Therapist: How's that been? ; Patient: Well, it's fine. ; Patient: I can focus on what I need to focus on. ; Therapist: You do okay with that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you ever have thoughts of death or dying? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Any drug or alcohol use? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How about medical conditions? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Have you ever seen or heard things other people cannot see or hear? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a time, you mentioned your mood is gloomy. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a time when your mood was too happy, like when you're excessively happy, a lot of energy? ; Patient: Not really. ; Patient: I mean, you know, like there's been times where I've like gone on vacation for like a week and I've noticed that I was happier than I had been, but nothing ever more than a couple of days or a week or so. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You ever been hospitalized before? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you have feelings of hopelessness? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And how's your self-esteem? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: It's okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Pretty good? ; Therapist: All right, Sherry. ; Therapist: I'd like to get you in to see a counselor here at the agency. ; Therapist: It'll probably just take a couple days to get you in with somebody. ; Therapist: Is that okay?

; Patient: I mean, no, not anymore so than usual. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself talking more or feeling like you should talk more? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: In fact, I don't want to talk to people because I feel like something they're going to say is going to annoy me. ; Therapist: How's your sleep been? ; Patient: Um, fine. ; Patient: Haven't had any disturbances in it. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: Sometimes like when I'm first going to bed, like my thoughts will take me a while to like get to sleep and like have my thoughts like shut down. ; Patient: But it doesn't take too long. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So your sleep's been okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Have you noticed that you're all down or like have depressed mood or anything like that? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Are you still finding activities that were pleasurable to be pleasurable now? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Well, I mean, sometimes an activity that I like, something will come along and like I'll get distracted during it by something that like irritates me. ; Patient: But for the most part I can get over it and like enjoy the activity if it's something I genuinely enjoy. ; Therapist: Any change of appetite? ; Patient: Um, no. ; Therapist: How about any feelings of worthlessness? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that. ; Therapist: You mentioned that you're being distracted easily. ; Therapist: Is this affecting your concentration? ; Patient: A little bit. ; Therapist: A little bit? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you have any thoughts regarding death or dying? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Like that. ; Therapist: And this irritable mood has been bothering you at work and you mentioned driving home. ; Therapist: Any other places? ; Patient: I mean, yeah, just because it's not just at work and driving home. ; Patient: Like, you know, some of my mom sat on the phone the other day, irritated me and then I cut the phone call short and I get to talk to my dad because I was mad. ; Patient: And so that like affected that. ; Patient: So a little bit of like my personal life too. ; Therapist: Any drug or alcohol usage recently? ; Therapist: Nothing. ; Therapist: Have you ever seen or heard things other people can't see or hear? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: That's never happened? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'd like to get you in to see somebody today, if that's okay. ; Therapist: We have a counselor that's available that can talk to you some more about this. ; Therapist: That'd be all right?

; Therapist: What would you call it? ; Patient: According to my husband, I'm having a little bit of trouble with anger or something like that, but to me it's like... ; Therapist: Alright, so your husband believes you're having some trouble with anger? ; Patient: My husband thinks so, but to me I'm just fine. ; Patient: He's just... ; Patient: I may yell a little here and there at him, but he's a man. ; Patient: He should get over it. ; Patient: He's bigger than me, stronger than me. ; Patient: I got... ; Patient: Look, it's the way I get my point across. ; Patient: It's what I gotta do sometimes. ; Therapist: Alright, so you have a... you feel like you have a relational style that doesn't match what he wants? ; Therapist: Like you're yelling and he's not liking that? ; Patient: It's how I communicate. ; Therapist: It's how you communicate. ; Patient: If he's not happy with it, that's about... he's gonna have to deal with it. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about the yelling? ; Patient: He says this all the time. ; Patient: But to me it's what I do. ; Patient: If I want him to take the trash out, I tell him to take the trash out. ; Patient: He says I yell at him. ; Patient: We get into a fight over it. ; Patient: Just an argument over it. ; Patient: Nothing serious. ; Patient: But he says this for everything I do. ; Patient: Getting the kids ready to school, for school. ; Patient: He says I yell at the kids. ; Patient: He says I can't make anything simple. ; Patient: I can't just make a simple request. ; Patient: He says I have to yell at him. ; Patient: I have to start a fight. ; Patient: I say, he's a man up. ; Therapist: So you don't feel like you have a problem with yelling or anger or anything? ; Patient: I don't think it's a problem, no. ; Therapist: It's just the way you communicate? ; Patient: It's the way I am. ; Therapist: Has it been causing you... it's been causing you some trouble with your husband? ; Therapist: Any other trouble? ; Patient: Maybe with the husband. ; Patient: You know, I almost got into an argument with the neighbor, but we dealt with that. ; Patient: He told my husband. ; Patient: He agreed with her and, well, he said I should get help. ; Therapist: All right, so it's caused you some difficulties in that way. ; Patient: To me, it's not a difficulty for him. ; Patient: It's more of a difficulty for him than it is for me. ; Therapist: So you're really here today because he's asked you to come in? ; Patient: I'm here. ; Patient: He's my husband. ; Patient: So I respect him. ; Patient: I want to make him happy, so I said I'll go. ; Therapist: All right, but you're really not convinced that you have a problem? ; Patient: I don't see it as a problem. ; Patient: He's more of a problem than I am. ; Therapist: He's convinced you're not? ; Patient: I don't think I'm a problem. ; Patient: I don't think I have a problem. ; Patient: He says it's all the yelling and I need help and it's time I do something about it. ; Patient: I say, all right, fine, I'll go see about it. ; Therapist: Would your relationship be a little easier without the yelling? ; Patient: For him it would be, I guess. ; Patient: But it may be. ; Patient: We could try it, but I don't know. ; Patient: But it's hard, but it's what I do. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about some of the events that you think lead to the yelling? ; Patient: He doesn't get what I'm trying to say. ; Patient: It could be something as he wants to do it his way. ; Patient: We could be driving. ; Patient: All right, no, honey, I said we want to go this way. ; Patient: Oh, wait, why are you going that way? ; Patient: No, look, no one get into a fight in the car. ; Patient: Or, okay, honey, that's not how you do the dishes. ; Patient: It could be something as simple as that. ; Patient: No, you wash out the dishes. ; Patient: No, that's not how you do the dishes. ; Patient: It could be something like that. ; Patient: We get into an argument. ; Patient: It's just over the simplest things. ; Therapist: And in that argument, how do you find the distribution of who's yelling? ; Therapist: Is it mostly you yelling or are you both yelling? ; Patient: I feel like I have to yell to get my point across, but he's not 100% innocent in this either. ; Patient: It's not my fault. ; Patient: I wouldn't have to yell if he listened the first time. ; Therapist: Do you ever find yourself planning to get into an argument, or is it more spontaneous?

; Patient: Well, I knew I felt different. ; Patient: I didn't know I was depressed. ; Therapist: But you knew something was wrong. ; Patient: I didn't feel like myself. ; Patient: I haven't been feeling like myself, no. ; Therapist: Tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself. ; Patient: Well, you know, I just go to work, and I come home, and I sleep. ; Patient: I wake up in the morning, and I'm still tired. ; Patient: I just have no energy. ; Therapist: So you sleep a lot, but even though you're sleeping, you don't wake up rested. ; Patient: No, not at all. ; Therapist: Doesn't sound like good quality sleep. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I just have no energy. ; Patient: I don't want to do anything but just sleep. ; Therapist: How long has that been going on? ; Patient: Hmm. ; Patient: I guess a couple months. ; Therapist: Two or three months. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What else is going on, Albina? ; Patient: Well, you know, I've been drinking more. ; Patient: I mean, I drink socially, but I find myself that when I come home, you know, I have a glass of wine, and then I just go to sleep. ; Therapist: And that's worrisome to you? ; Patient: It is, because I don't usually drink that often during the week. ; Patient: So it's increased. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I can see where that would be. ; Therapist: Bothersome to you. ; Therapist: What else is going on with you? ; Patient: Well, you know, my mom died a year ago, so Mother's Day is coming up. ; Patient: So, you know, I've been thinking about mom a lot. ; Patient: I miss her a lot. ; Therapist: That anniversary is close. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, that's particularly hard when those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents. ; Therapist: That's a very difficult time. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And I took care of mom. ; Patient: So that's hard, because for a long time, well, she was sick and she died from cancer, so I took care of her. ; Patient: So for a long time, that's all I did was take care of mom and work. ; Patient: So now that she's gone, it just kind of brings up everything all over again. ; Therapist: There's kind of a hole in your life. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: We were really close. ; Therapist: Well, I'm really sorry for your loss, and thank you for sharing that with me. ; Therapist: I know that's very difficult. ; Therapist: So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected. ; Therapist: You're not getting good quality sleep. ; Therapist: You're really fatigued. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Just kind of going through the motions, it sounds like, during the day. ; Therapist: And then, how's your appetite been? ; Patient: Not really eating that much. ; Patient: You know, because I don't have energy. ; Patient: You know, before I would come home, cook dinner, or, you know, meet some friends after work. ; Patient: But I don't want to do that. ; Patient: I just come home and have a glass of wine and just go to bed. ; Therapist: So you used to be more socially involved than you are now. ; Patient: Yeah, I don't do anything now. ; Therapist: A little more isolated. ; Patient: Yeah, just work and come home and sleep. ; Therapist: So, if there was something that you could do about this, what do you think you might like to do? ; Patient: Well, I don't want to stay like this. ; Patient: This isn't who I am, you know, just sleeping all the time. ; Patient: It's just, I don't want to stay this way. ; Therapist: It kind of feels like you're stuck at this point. ; Patient: Yeah, I just don't want to do anything or go out with my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep. ; Patient: I don't want to do that. ; Therapist: It's kind of the same old routine. ; Therapist: I wonder if it would be okay if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Would that be all right? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Most of the time, we typically think about medication as a possible answer. ; Patient: Mm. ; Therapist: So, no medication at this point. ; Patient: I don't want any medication. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Then, I think as important, certainly, perhaps more important than medication is counseling and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and getting some feedback on that. ; Patient: I'm okay with that. ; Patient: You know, when Mom was sick, she was in hospice care, so she had cancer. ; Patient: And the nurses and the doctors had our family talk to someone about what we were feeling, what we had to face. ; Therapist: So that was a pretty good experience? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: To talk to someone that understood what we were going through. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: Something else might be exercise. ; Therapist: Another possibility would be a natural product. ; Therapist: There are some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate. ; Therapist: And that's another thing that we could talk about if you wanted to learn a little bit more about those. ; Patient: Maybe something natural. ; Patient: Exercise. ; Patient: I don't have energy. ; Patient: I don't want to... ; Patient: I just don't feel like doing anything, so I know I'm not going to exercise right now. ; Patient: But if it's something that's natural, you know, I could maybe try that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If it's okay, let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute, and then we can hit some of those other things too. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, is there a counselor that you know or that you have a relationship with? ; Therapist: This lady that worked with you during your mom's death, is she... ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Someone that's out in the community? ; Patient: She was really nice from... Yeah. ; Patient: I liked her. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that. ; Therapist: Could you say on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being really ready, 0 being not ready at all, how ready would you be to do some counseling? ; Patient: Maybe like a 6 or a 7. ; Therapist: So a 6 or a 7. ; Therapist: Why a 6 or a 7 and not a 4 or a 5? ; Patient: Well, because I don't want to stay like this, and you know, I've already talked to her before. ; Patient: She was really nice, so I wouldn't mind going back to her, and she told me, you know, when I saw her last time, if ever needed, I could come back. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you've got a connection there already. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's really good. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, if that's okay then, would it be alright if we talked a little bit about the exercise? ; Therapist: I know you said it didn't really sound like an option for you at this time, and that's perfectly fine. ; Therapist: Perfectly fine. ; Therapist: Only you can make those decisions, Alvena. ; Therapist: But if it's okay, I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Exercise is, again, in a number of studies, has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I didn't know that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: It actually raises serotonin. ; Therapist: Have you heard about serotonin? ; Patient: Yeah, I have. ; Therapist: It's kind of a happy hormone. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF, which is, well, it doesn't really matter what it is, but it helps actually your brain actually grow and help repair itself. ; Therapist: So exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress, certainly, and then actually improving the quality of sleep. ; Therapist: How does that sound at this point? ; Patient: Well, if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again, does that mean I don't have to go on the medication? ; Patient: Right now, we can try that? ; Therapist: Absolutely. ; Therapist: Again, those are your decisions, and I'm here to really support you in those. ; Therapist: So if those sound like things that you might be willing to do, I'm all for it. ; Patient: Well, I'll try that if I don't have to go on the medication. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I have some friends that exercise and work out that I could probably call and exercise with them. ; Therapist: So you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Is that something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group? ; Patient: Yeah, I have friends that run and friends that go to the gym. ; Patient: I have some friends that walk after work. ; Therapist: So it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Which of those tend to interest you most? ; Patient: Well, then also, you know, my church on the weekends, they have exercise classes too. ; Patient: So, yeah, but I think, I guess I don't have energy really to exercise, but I'll try it. ; Patient: But I'll definitely call the person I had talked to when mom passed away, and I'll do that right away. ; Therapist: Very good. ; Therapist: Well, I think it sounds like this is important for you to feel better, and it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan. ; Therapist: How do you see this fitting into your life at this point? ; Therapist: Again, kind of getting back to the counseling and the exercise. ; Patient: Well, when I saw her, I could see her after work. ; Patient: So I can call her and see if I can still see her after work for therapy. ; Patient: And exercise, I mean, I can do that, you know, after work or on the weekends. ; Patient: My friends, they exercise various times. ; Patient: So, yeah. ; Therapist: Let's talk a little bit more about that. ; Therapist: Let's say on a scale of, if we can use another one of those scales, zero being confident that you could start an exercise program, zero being not very confident at all, and ten being very confident. ; Therapist: Tell me where you are in this exercise thing. ; Patient: Honestly, maybe a five. ; Patient: I'll try it. ; Patient: Anything, if I have to do that so I don't have to go on medication, then I'll try it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That sounds like a pretty strong commitment. ; Patient: Yes, I'll try it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point then. ; Patient: Well, you know, my friends have been calling, but, you know, I'm just sleeping all the time. ; Patient: So when they call, I'm asleep. ; Patient: So I haven't really called them back. ; Patient: But, you know, I can just return their calls and just let them know I'll want to meet up with them and, you know, at least maybe just start walking. ; Therapist: I think that's a great decision. ; Therapist: You have a couple of friends in mind that you could call? ; Patient: Yeah, I have real close friends that live not too far from me. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with the exercise. ; Patient: Well, I probably shouldn't come home. ; Patient: I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friend's house after work and change with her. ; Therapist: It would be difficult to do it in the morning. ; Therapist: You don't see that happening. ; Patient: No, because it's so hard when I get up in the morning. ; Patient: I'm so tired that I can't see doing it in the morning. ; Therapist: And you think it would be easier to do it after work? ; Patient: Because I'm already out. ; Patient: Yeah, as long as I don't come home. ; Patient: So I come home and want to go to sleep. ; Therapist: Come home, it's over. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Well, good. ; Therapist: It sounds like we have a plan for the counselor. ; Therapist: And when you check out today, I will put this in your record. ; Therapist: And we'll want to get in touch with the counselor that you worked with when your mom was going through her passing and the grief situation. ; Therapist: And then I'll want to depend upon you to call your friends and then get involved in the exercise program. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I'll try that. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: And if it's okay, I'd like to call you in a week to one, see how you're feeling and two, if the exercise is helping. ; Therapist: You may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial, you may actually look forward to it. ; Therapist: Because my hope is that it will actually help you feel better and improve your mood. ; Therapist: And then I would also like to see you back in two weeks just to check on things. ; Therapist: Now, we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point. ; Therapist: But I want you to know, you can call anytime and I will work to get you in. ; Therapist: And that might be something that we need to do if our plan is not working. ; Patient: Okay.",

; Patient: It's been okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, in our last session together, we talked about your lack of confidence. ; Therapist: Do you feel like you've made any progress on that? ; Patient: Um, I mean, I've been journaling, like you said. ; Therapist: Good, good. ; Patient: Um, I've spent time helping. ; Patient: Uh, I feel like there's still a lot of room for improvement though. ; Patient: But it has improved slightly. ; Therapist: So, when you said you've been journaling, were you able to, when you had a negative thought, or you know, a situation occurred where you had a negative thought, were you writing down a negative thought? ; Patient: Yeah, um, not automatic. ; Patient: Well, I was thinking what you told me. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And you were able to make it a positive thought? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I tried, um, to do that. ; Patient: It helped some, but, uh, I guess any improvement's better. ; Patient: But, uh, I think maybe just to keep doing it, maybe it'll get better. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: But I was more aware of how things are occurring. ; Therapist: Good. ; Patient: I didn't realize how often. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Sorry. ; Therapist: No, so do you remember kind of what we discussed last time about how CBT works? ; Patient: Um, a little bit. ; Patient: Um, not exactly. ; Patient: But I just remember how my thoughts. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Are causing things. ; Therapist: So would you come out to our view before we actually get into this session? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Would that be okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So how it goes is like, say a situation or an event happens, you have a thought, okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And like I know last time it was your lack of confidence, and it could be like, I'm not good enough, and that was your thought process last time, correct? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And then so when you have a thought, you have an emotion. ; Therapist: Last time you were saying how it made you feel bad about yourself. ; Therapist: You felt incompetent. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And then your behavior is you were, you know, you lashed out at others and you were mean. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So do you feel like that you kind of understand that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So I know last time, like I said, we talked about your lack of confidence. ; Therapist: So for today, I know you mentioned that you also were having problems with using marijuana and depression, you had problems with depression, and you also had anger issues. ; Therapist: And out of those, which one do you think you'd like to discuss today? ; Patient: Probably the anger issues. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I feel like that's the biggest problem going on right now. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Tell me a little bit more about your anger issues. ; Patient: I mean, it's not like I'm just like an angry person. ; Patient: It just like snaps at anybody. ; Patient: But I get defensive, I guess. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I'm very defensive. ; Patient: And then I usually want to lash out. ; Patient: But I've never, I've lashed out at my child, you know, my son or anything. ; Patient: It's usually always my husband. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about the last time you lashed out at your husband? ; Patient: We were unloading the groceries. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: And I actually had just had my hair done and cut and colored and everything. ; Patient: And I was so excited because I thought he was going to love it, you know. ; Patient: And he looked at it and he, of course, he thought, well, how much money did it cost? ; Patient: And, you know, girl, you know, these things are kind of expensive. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: And so I told him, you know, it would have been $60. ; Patient: And he told me that, you know, we've been struggling with money lately a little bit. ; Patient: And that I didn't need to spend that much money and that I was selfish. ; Patient: And then I hit him. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So now what I'm writing down here is kind of like what we talked about, how there's an event or a situation. ; Therapist: You have a thought and you have an emotion. ; Therapist: I know like with what you were just saying, the event or the situation was that you got your hair done. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And that he was angry about that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: He was just, yeah, he was just saying mean things. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Now, what did you, in that moment when he was being mean, what was, not how you felt, but what was your actual thought? ; Therapist: Like when he was saying all that stuff and? ; Patient: I'm selfish. ; Therapist: You thought I'm selfish. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Initially, yeah, that was it. ; Patient: He's right. ; Patient: I believe that was selfish. ; Therapist: How did that make you feel when you actually thought I'm selfish? ; Patient: Guilty. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you felt guilty? ; Patient: Sad. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And then angry. ; Therapist: Angry. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Very angry. ; Patient: But he made me feel that way. ; Patient: I wasn't feeling that way before he said that. ; Patient: And then once he said that, you know, he put that thought in my head and it made me angry. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So when he was getting mad at you and then telling you you're selfish and you felt selfish or you thought to yourself, I'm selfish, and then you got angry, what did you do after you got angry? ; Patient: I smacked him. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yep. ; Therapist: So there was physical contact there. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I hit him upside his head. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I mean, I felt that afterwards. ; Patient: Me too. ; Patient: It's just I was so mad. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: How do you feel that way? ; Therapist: Uh-huh. ; Patient: I just, I lashed out. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So when he has these, when he kind of gets upset at you for certain things like this, how do you think you could change from you smacking him to having a more calm and positive response? ; Patient: Well, I think if I was able to get his angry. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How do you think you might be able to do that? ; Therapist: Like this is how we would do it. ; Therapist: With CBT, we would change your thought. ; Therapist: So when he gets upset with you and calls you selfish, you start to feel selfish. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So how could you not feel selfish? ; Therapist: Do you think you could change your thought? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, if I never even thought that I was selfish, then I wouldn't be getting angry. ; Therapist: So do you think you're selfish? ; Patient: I mean, at the time I did that and I felt like awful. ; Patient: But now, like, he says that we're hurting for money, but we're really not. ; Patient: Like, we're able to pay our bills. ; Patient: We're able to do things. ; Patient: I mean, he's just kind of like a cheap person. ; Patient: But we have plenty of money to, we're not hurting at all. ; Patient: And with my self-confidence, I don't think it was selfish in one. ; Patient: Make myself feel prettier, you know? ; Patient: But I think people do other selfish tendencies like that. ; Therapist: So what I'm hearing you say is you don't think you're selfish at all. ; Patient: Well, I mean, I'm selfish. ; Therapist: But in this situation, you don't think you're being selfish. ; Patient: I don't think I'm just wrong. ; Patient: I really don't. ; Patient: Now, if I had gone by a whole new wardrobe, nothing else, none along with it, but I mean, I just did my hair. ; Patient: And he's a real estate agent. ; Patient: He had sold a big house that week, so we had enough money for me to afford it. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: So he's just a pain in the juice sometimes. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So instead of thinking I'm selfish, what could you actually think? ; Patient: That I deserve to spend money on myself. ; Patient: I don't want to spend money on me sometimes. ; Therapist: I deserve this. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I mean, who doesn't deserve something every now and then, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, so if you were thinking I deserve this, if that was your thought when he was getting in, if you thought, no, I deserve this, how do you think that would actually make you feel? ; Therapist: What kind of emotion would you feel at that point? ; Therapist: Would that make you feel confident? ; Patient: Yeah, confident in my decision. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: I would still feel a little sad that he thought that, but I don't think it would be to the level that it was when I thought I was selfish. ; Therapist: So if you felt confident about your decision because you actually changed your thought, do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you actually getting angry, you would think there's no need for this? ; Patient: Yeah, I think it would help me realize that that's his issue and I won't. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So how do you think you would actually behave then? ; Patient: Walk off. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Or even be able to, this is kind of what I wanted to get to as well, be able to express it in a non-violent manner. ; Patient: Because he didn't deserve for me to hit on him. ; Patient: I mean, he didn't. ; Patient: He said something that upset me, but no one deserves that. ; Patient: Someone's hand is put on him. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So maybe instead of thinking also that you're selfish when he's getting my back, do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead that maybe he just doesn't understand and maybe I need to tell him that I do deserve this and explain it to him that this makes me feel good about myself? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, I could try that. ; Therapist: Because you know, you know you're not selfish. ; Therapist: It's just something that makes you feel good. ; Patient: And I think also he understood why I did it. ; Patient: Because I mean, he knows that I have some self-conscious issues, but I don't think he realizes how bad it was or why I got my hair cut. ; Patient: I think he's seen it as just the most girly things. ; Patient: He didn't realize that it made me feel better about myself, you know? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: So that might help as well. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Which goes back to his presidencies. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So do you think in like the next coming week that you could actually change your thoughts? ; Therapist: In turn to change how you feel? ; Patient: I could try, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Since we talked about your anger issues, I know you were saying last time that you were also having problems with depression. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And you were also having problems with your marijuana use. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And either one of those, would you like to discuss that? ; Therapist: Or I mean, would you like to discuss your anger issues further? ; Patient: No, we can talk about the depression. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What do you think triggers your depression? ; Therapist: What makes you depressed? ; Patient: Well, my son kind of at the age where he doesn't want me to be involved in his life. ; Patient: And I've kind of always been the housewife. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: And he's at, and he's always been my wife, you know? ; Patient: I did everything with him. ; Patient: I went to all his practices with him. ; Patient: And he's mommy's little boy. ; Patient: But he's not mommy's little boy anymore. ; Patient: And so now he's kind of growing up and doing his own thing. ; Patient: And then I'm kind of left alone. ; Therapist: How old is your son? ; Patient: He's 14. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's an interesting age. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And so he's kind of telling me there's any little man who he'll tell him I said that, he'd probably have been there. ; Patient: But, and like, and I don't know if that's where it comes from, but I know that that's here lately. ; Patient: You know, I'm used to him being at home, and now I'm staying with friends, and I'm home by myself a lot. ; Patient: Or he doesn't like for me to call him, or no more kisses, and you know. ; Patient: And I know that it's normal, but it still makes me feel really depressed. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, the situation here is that your son doesn't want to be involved with you as much. ; Therapist: Do you feel like that's accurate? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And then he's just growing up. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what do you think to yourself when he doesn't want to talk to mom anymore, and he doesn't want to be mom's little boy, and he's out doing his own thing? ; Patient: Well, I mean like, this week I was taking on his football schedule. ; Patient: He's a big football player. ; Patient: You wouldn't believe it, but a big old boy came out of me. ; Patient: And, there you go boy. ; Patient: And he, so I was taking on his football schedule, and he got upset at me because he felt like I was getting in his business and trying to mommy him. ; Patient: And I was just trying to make sure that he was going to be able to make it through all the time, that he had all the clothes necessary. ; Patient: And I asked him if he needed a ride and things like that, and he just felt like I was getting into his business. ; Patient: And it just made me feel like I'm not needed anymore. ; Therapist: So when he, what is your exact thought though when this kind of stuff happens? ; Patient: I'm not needed anymore. ; Patient: And that situation is what I thought is I'm not needed anymore. ; Therapist: Yeah, and that's hard when you've always been needed before. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How does that make you feel? ; Therapist: What kind of emotion? ; Patient: I mean sad. ; Patient: I was really sad. ; Patient: Um, lonely. ; Patient: I felt really lonely. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And then, what did you do? ; Therapist: How did you get into that situation? ; Patient: Um, I actually, I guess, decided to move out a little bit. ; Patient: I spent a couple of drinks. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you think you use the marijuana also because you're depressed? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So that it kind of all... ; Patient: Yeah, I mean I never used it before. ; Patient: I mean it just started like when I started to feel sad and depressed. ; Patient: So yeah, I think that it did. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, and what I'm hearing you saying, correct me if I'm wrong, is that your son doesn't want to be involved anymore. ; Therapist: You don't feel like you're needed. ; Therapist: That's what you say to yourself and that makes you feel sad and lonely. ; Therapist: And then in turn you use marijuana. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, do you want to use marijuana? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I mean, I don't want my son, if he ever found out, like, that would be a good influence on him and I don't think that's a good influence. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Sorry. ; Therapist: That's okay. ; Therapist: So what I kind of wanted you to do for the next session is kind of what we were continuing what we were doing last week. ; Therapist: You know how you journaled and when you have a negative thought that you changed it to a positive thought. ; Therapist: And then in turn you saw maybe like how it could change your behavior. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Or your emotional behavior. ; Therapist: So do you think maybe you could do that again? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Like when times such as when your son, you know, is kind of doesn't want to run around, you think instead of I'm not needed, instead of thinking I'm not needed anymore, thinking, you know, he's growing up, that's good. ; Therapist: I've raised, you know, a son that's active and who is enjoying life. ; Therapist: And then how would that make you feel if you actually thought that to yourself? ; Patient: I mean, yeah, I mean, that might make me feel better. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: You know, because he's probably in a good place and active and social and a good person because of you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So that would make you happy, I would think. ; Therapist: And then, you know, maybe then you could, you know, have a different behavior or do something different. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So journaling, does that sound good? ; Patient: Yeah, I'll try it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Good.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Kyle, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing alright. ; Patient: I'm not doing too bad. ; Patient: How are you Dr. Grande? ; Therapist: Not bad, thanks for asking. ; Therapist: What brings you in? ; Patient: So my girlfriend saw your ad in the paper and she saw out of some of the things that you work on, one of them is smoking cessation and it bothers her that I smoke. ; Patient: So she has been nagging me for like weeks to come in and talk to you. ; Patient: So I figured I would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it. ; Therapist: So you came into therapy today because your girlfriend pressured you? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean it's easier for me like if I come in here and talk to you, I can spend like 45 minutes with you compared to hours of her nagging me through the week. ; Therapist: So you weighed the cost benefit and decided to come in? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean it's covered by insurance, it's just 45 minutes of my time. ; Therapist: And what she would like you to do, and this is her goal, not yours, would be to stop smoking. ; Therapist: Tell me what your goal is. ; Patient: I mean I don't really have one. ; Patient: I don't think smoking is that bad. ; Patient: Well I mean I don't know, smoking could be bad but it's never bothered me. ; Patient: I don't know, I really don't have any goals to come in besides just having her stop bugging me. ; Therapist: So do you have a goal of quitting smoking? ; Patient: No, not at all. ; Patient: There's so many good things about smoking. ; Patient: What really got me into it was I smoke a lot at work because it gives me one-on-one time with the boss. ; Patient: So the fact that I can get that time with my boss is completely worth it. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about some of the other good things about smoking? ; Patient: It's just like, it's how I meet people. ; Patient: So like if I, I'll have cigarettes on me but I don't have a lighter and that kind of keeps me from finishing off a pack. ; Patient: Because I could finish off a pack a day. ; Patient: But if I don't have a lighter then I carry the cigarettes around with me and then if I see other people are smoking I can go and ask for a light. ; Patient: And that's always kind of like a way in to get to these groups. ; Patient: I've just met so many different people from smoking. ; Therapist: So smoking, the way you're presenting it, has been a positive thing in your life? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean I only do it socially. ; Patient: So that's, yeah. ; Therapist: Are there any negative aspects to smoking? ; Patient: I mean yeah, I mean everyone knows smoking is unhealthy but like I don't, I don't smoke a lot. ; Patient: Like I only smoke from time to time and it's mostly just on the weekends. ; Patient: So it's like, I don't know, occasionally if I smoke over the weekends I might have like a cough maybe. ; Patient: Like a heavy cough on Mondays, Tuesdays, it's gone by Wednesdays so it's not really that big of a deal. ; Therapist: So you don't seem like you're too worried about the negative aspects. ; Patient: No, I mean like the, obviously it's unhealthy but like one of the things I'm trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people. ; Patient: And like the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than like giving it up for health reasons I think. ; Therapist: So let me ask you a question. ; Therapist: I want you to give me a response between one and ten. ; Therapist: This is called scaling. ; Therapist: And it's to do with the importance of stopping smoking. ; Therapist: So one would be it's not important to you and ten would be it's extremely important to you. ; Therapist: Where do you think you'd put that number? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Maybe like a two. ; Patient: Like it'd be cool to get rid of the cough on Mondays but that, getting rid of that is not worth everything else I get from smoking. ; Therapist: So not particularly important? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Now let me ask you the same question except instead of importance, how confident, we're talking about confidence, how confident are you that you could quit smoking? ; Therapist: On a scale of one to ten with one being not confident at all and ten being extremely confident. ; Patient: I could say probably like an eight or a nine. ; Patient: Like I could give it up. ; Patient: Actually I gave it up recently like for like a month and I didn't even crave it. ; Patient: But eventually like just seeing all my friends go out smoking, like I missed that so I just started up again. ; Patient: But I don't know. ; Patient: Like if I really wanted to give it up for good I'm sure I could. ; Therapist: So stopping smoking is not important to you but you're fairly confident you could if you decided to do it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn't seem like you're interested in stopping smoking, what would be a goal? ; Therapist: How could we spend this time so that it would be productive? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Like I guess it would help to be able to like explain to my girlfriend like the stuff that I get from smoking. ; Patient: And like you seem, you kind of seem like you get it. ; Patient: So like I don't know maybe figure out ways to like explain to her the things that I get from smoking to like I don't know just kind of help her like realize why I do it other than just to kill myself. ; Therapist: So to help her to understand why the smoking works for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So that's one goal. ; Therapist: Any other goals you could think of? ; Therapist: I mean you came in in part because, well it seemed like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So any other relational goals you might want to work on there? ; Patient: Um, I don't know. ; Patient: We haven't really been, like we've been fighting a lot because of the smoking. ; Patient: Um, so I think like maybe figuring out ways, I don't know, like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in a way. ; Patient: Like I don't know how to describe that but like having fights that are productive like that just don't always end like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us leaving the house. ; Patient: But like I guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doesn't last for like days. ; Therapist: So productive communication and productive arguments. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So she understands how important it is to you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because it does seem like it's really important to you. ; Therapist: But another would be to work on your relation, your relational style so that you can end the argument and feel like you're not a stalemate. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, I think that would be cool. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Well, you want to make those the goals we work on so we can spend this time productive fast? ; Patient: Yeah, I can deal with that. ; Patient: It's kind of like killing two birds with one stone. ; Therapist: Does that make sense to you? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, that's what we'll do. ; Therapist: So what I'd like you to do, I'll see you again in about a week. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So if you could reflect on some of these changes that you think you can make with this relationship, what you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator. ; Therapist: Because a lot of this revolves around communication, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Communicating the advantages of smoking but also communicating and the arguing so that you have a productive end to these arguments. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, that would be cool if we could do that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So if you could work on kind of thinking that through and then next time we meet we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes in that relationship to meet those goals. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Patient: Sounds good. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Thanks for coming in, Kyle. ; Patient: Yeah, thank you.",

Tell me about your drinking. ; Patient: Well, my family, you know, my family are all big partiers, they all really like to drink. ; Patient: It's something I've been surrounded by a lot, but I've been having these really intense cravings that I really feel like I want to drink. ; Patient: When I'm at work, I'm just like, I could really use a drink right now. ; Patient: That really worries me. ; Patient: I'm just nervous it's becoming a problem. ; Therapist: So, sometimes at work you've been having cravings for alcohol. ; Therapist: Any other times when you've been having cravings? ; Patient: Yeah, it's kind of when I'm at home, you know, not really doing anything. ; Patient: I could go for a beer right now. ; Therapist: So, other than that feeling of having the craving, is there anything you do after you have the craving? ; Patient: Yeah, sometimes I'll have a drink. ; Patient: I just feel like I want to give into it. ; Therapist: How much do you drink? ; Patient: Like a beer or two. ; Therapist: Is this when, do you work in the day? ; Therapist: Is this when you're at work in the day? ; Patient: Oh no, after work I'll go and have a drink. ; Therapist: So, when you're having cravings at work, you're not drinking there? ; Patient: No, no. ; Therapist: So, tell me about your typical alcohol consumption in a week. ; Patient: I like to, on Fridays, after work, after a long week, that's kind of when I really crave it. ; Patient: I go have a drink with some friends. ; Patient: I'll have a drink sometimes with dinner. ; Patient: I'll find that a social event. ; Patient: I kind of feel like I want to have a drink then. ; Patient: And I don't really want to feel that way. ; Patient: I feel like that might be a problem. ; Therapist: You're worried that the craving is indicating that you have an alcohol. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you ever tried to cut down your drinking and you're unable to do so? ; Patient: Well, I mean, usually I'm able to limit my days. ; Patient: If I say I'm going to go to a party this weekend, I'll have one. ; Patient: And, you know, usually I can stick to it. ; Patient: I don't really feel to it, I guess. ; Therapist: Do you spend a lot of time trying to obtain alcohol? ; Patient: Um, no. ; Patient: I guess not. ; Patient: I mean, I think about where I could, when I have a craving, I think about when I want to have it. ; Patient: But I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about it or trying to get it. ; Therapist: How about in terms of your responsibilities? ; Therapist: Have you failed to uphold any of your responsibilities because of your drinking? ; Patient: Maybe I haven't gone home from work right away when I have to put my clothes away or do some laundry. ; Patient: You know, because I'd rather just go have a drink with my friends. ; Patient: No major responsibilities, no work responsibilities or anything like that have been missed. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do you have any social problems because of your drinking? ; Patient: Well, no, I guess not. ; Patient: I mean, I get really friendly when I have a drink, so I don't really think that's a problem. ; Patient: But, no, I guess not. ; Therapist: It hasn't caused any social problems. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself giving up important activities because you're drinking instead? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I usually do what I need to do and if I have to go to a shower or something, brown shower, maybe. ; Patient: I usually go to them. ; Patient: Maybe I think about it while I'm there that I'd like to have a beer at this. ; Patient: Why isn't there any beer here? ; Patient: But I still attend the things that I need to attend. ; Therapist: So you're thinking about it, maybe still some craving, but you're still going, you're still participating. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Are you engaging in any activities that are dangerous because of the drinking? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Drinking and driving, anything like that, nothing like that. ; Patient: Well, no. ; Patient: I, no, I guess not. ; Therapist: There's nothing like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Do you have any physical or mental health problems that are made worse by the drinking? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I wouldn't say worse. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Do you have any medical or mental health problems in general? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Do you find that you have to increase the amount of alcohol you're drinking to get the same effect? ; Patient: I usually have around the same amount every time. ; Patient: So I guess I would say no. ; Patient: I never really go all out, not a ton of drinks, but so, no. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: And you've been drinking, you say you've been drinking about the same amount each time you drink. ; Therapist: Have you noticed that the effect has been diminished? ; Therapist: Like you're not getting the same effect from the alcohol? ; Patient: I usually feel the same. ; Therapist: Feel the same way? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you ever noticed any symptoms when you stop drinking, like a withdrawal? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: Well, what do you mean really by withdrawal? ; Therapist: Like when you stop using alcohol, are you finding that you're anxious, depressed, you have physical reactions? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Alright, Jackie. ; Therapist: I appreciate you telling me about what's going on and answering my questions. ; Therapist: If you're okay with it, I'll get you in to see a counselor. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I'll get that scheduled and we can go from there. ; Therapist: Okay, thank you very much.",

; Patient: Ah, just weed. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: It's no big deal, really. ; Patient: I don't know why she's so upset. ; Therapist: She's upset about that? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: She's been on me for a while about it, so... ; Therapist: Are there any other drugs or alcohol or anything that you consume? ; Patient: Well, yeah, I drink sometimes, too. ; Therapist: You drink sometimes? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: But, no, like, yeah. ; Therapist: Not something she's concerned with? ; Patient: Um, well, I mean, nah. ; Patient: She's more concerned about the, ah, the weed, so... ; Therapist: Are you concerned with the alcohol or marijuana? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I don't think it's a problem. ; Therapist: You don't think it's a problem? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Can I ask you a few questions about it? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Of course. ; Therapist: Can you tell me when you first started using it, how that came about? ; Patient: Um, I think it was, ah, like, my sophomore year of high school. ; Patient: One of my friends offered it to me, so, you know, I was kind of feeling, having some anxiety, um, maybe had some anxiety about starting it, but, so I tried it. ; Patient: Um, yeah, it made me feel great. ; Patient: So, it made my anxiety go away, so... ; Therapist: It took the anxiety away? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Yeah, so I... ; Therapist: How long did you have the anxiety before the marijuana use? ; Patient: You know, probably during my adolescence, a couple years. ; Therapist: A couple years? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It wasn't anything crazy, but, you know, it affected my life a little bit, so I think it makes me feel a lot better now that I smoke it. ; Patient: It gets rid of that feeling. ; Therapist: So, you started, you started marijuana because a friend offered it to you and because you were anxious? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And then, how about from then on? ; Patient: Um, you know, I don't want to feel that anxiety anymore. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: I don't want to have to take any pills or anything, so I've kind of just kept doing it to make me feel great. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: It's great. ; Patient: Yeah, so, I think it's great. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: When was the last time you used? ; Patient: Mm, this morning. ; Therapist: This morning? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Did anything happen in particular that you think motivated your mother to bring in today? ; Patient: Mm, no, no. ; Patient: I think she kind of wants me to get out and get a job and everything. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: But, you know, I'm living my life. ; Patient: It's perfectly fine, really. ; Patient: I've got a little bit of money, but I'm not worried. ; Therapist: So, what do you want to happen? ; Therapist: What would your goal be? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I want to make my mom happy, but I don't really want to stop. ; Therapist: In order to make her happy, would you have to stop? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: I guess, but maybe she could learn to deal with it if I just acted a little differently when I was on it. ; Patient: I don't really want to stop because it makes me feel a little better, so. ; Therapist: She wants you to get a job, too? ; Patient: Yeah, ideally she would like me to. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Would employment involve drug screening? ; Patient: I mean, probably some of them. ; Therapist: Some? ; Patient: Some, if I tried, yeah. ; Patient: I haven't really made a big effort to look for anything. ; Therapist: You're not too worried about that right now? ; Patient: No, I mean, I think every day is a new day, a new chance for greatness, and it's going great so far, so. ; Therapist: Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your marijuana use? ; Patient: Yeah, that's fine. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you ever tried to cut down? ; Patient: No, no. ; Therapist: Have you ever taken in larger amounts than you wanted to, or for longer periods? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, sometimes I'll smoke more than I usually do. ; Patient: If I'm hanging out, or maybe one of those anxiety days are a little worse, I'll smoke some more. ; Therapist: How much time do you spend obtaining, using, recovering from marijuana? ; Patient: A good amount of time. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: I love it, so it's something I love to do. ; Therapist: It's a big part of your life? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's like my best friend. ; Therapist: Do you have a craving for marijuana? ; Patient: Yeah, I would say so. ; Patient: I want to do it, yeah, so. ; Therapist: Has it led to any social problems for you? ; Patient: I used to hang out with my friends a little more than I do, but I guess some of them think I do it a little too much. ; Therapist: Do they? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Has the marijuana use caused you to give up activities that were important to you? ; Patient: It is my important activity, you know? ; Patient: So not really? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Has the marijuana use caused any activity to become dangerous? ; Patient: Like what? ; Therapist: Like driving while under the influence, or anything like that? ; Patient: Yeah, I've done that. ; Patient: That's dangerous, that's no big deal. ; Therapist: That's dangerous? ; Patient: Yeah, I'm fine. ; Patient: I usually drive, but everybody does that. ; Therapist: Everybody does that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Now your mother, she drove you in today? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, she came with me. ; Therapist: Was she worried that you were under the influence of marijuana? ; Patient: Probably, but she's kind of a little used to it, I guess. ; Patient: Not used to it, but... ; Therapist: She's aware of it? ; Patient: Yeah, she's, yeah. ; Therapist: Do you have any history of mental health disorders? ; Patient: Just some anxiety. ; Therapist: Just anxiety? ; Therapist: How about medical problems? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: No, they're the worst. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do you notice that when you stop using, you have physical symptoms or anxiety? ; Patient: Well, yeah, I get the anxiety when I stop, you know. ; Therapist: What's the longest you have stopped for? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Just kidding. ; Patient: Yeah, I smoke every day, so a couple hours when I sleep. ; Therapist: When you sleep? ; Patient: A couple hours throughout the day, you know. ; Therapist: So, it's an everyday activity for you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And it's been that way for a while? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: For the past couple years, I would say. ; Therapist: Couple years? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright, Jackie, I know that your mom wants you to get counseling here. ; Therapist: Are you open to it? ; Patient: I don't really think I need it. ; Patient: But I'm sure she's, once I leave here, she's going to say you need to come back. ; Patient: So, we'll see, I guess. ; Therapist: You okay with giving it a try? ; Patient: Yeah, we'll see. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: I'll get you scheduled to see a counselor and we'll see where that goes from after your first appointment. ; Patient: Alright, I think. ; Therapist: Is that alright? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: I want to thank you for telling me what's going on, for answering my questions. ; Therapist: It's been helpful. ; Patient: Alright, thank you.",

How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well. ; Therapist: Thanks for asking. ; Therapist: I saw you last time a week ago, and I know you had some concerns with employment, working on employment. ; Therapist: But first, before we get into that, I wanted to check in to see how you're doing emotionally. ; Therapist: I know from last week, on a scale of 1 to 10, you said your depression was about 7. ; Therapist: How is it today? ; Patient: It's been up and down. ; Patient: I think today it's probably a 7 again, but, you know, I've been back down to a 9 lately. ; Patient: I guess maybe I feel a little better because I'm coming here and I know I get to talk about it a little bit. ; Patient: But I guess last time we were talking about me trying to get a job, a full-time job, and I think I just realized last week that it's really hard for me to work full-time. ; Patient: Right now, I'm doing the part-time thing with the work program, and they want us to do volunteer work in the afternoon if we haven't found a full-time job by a certain week. ; Patient: And I'm just, you know, just thinking about it. ; Patient: I just don't think I can do that. ; Patient: I just don't think I can work a full 8 hours every day. ; Patient: It's just too much. ; Therapist: So, you're having some concerns about full-time work and that level of energy you'd have to exert and that commitment. ; Therapist: Alright, so, would it be okay today if we kind of structured what we're going to do for this session? ; Therapist: So, if it's okay with you, I'd like to talk about that and get some more details about what's going on this week and your feelings surrounding that. ; Therapist: And, we touched on this a little bit in the last session, but I'd like to talk about your core beliefs, your central beliefs that might be contributing to some of these feelings of depression. ; Therapist: And then, for the last part, we'll work on, like we did before, some interventions to try to help you with what's going on at work and with your depressed mood. ; Therapist: We can make changes to this as needed. ; Therapist: I just want to start with an outline that we can have going in. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Therapist: Anything you want to add or take away from that? ; Patient: No, I mean, that makes sense. ; Therapist: Okay, great. ; Therapist: So, tell me a little bit more about what's going on with the work. ; Patient: Well, I mean, I don't really know why it is. ; Patient: I know I'm always tired because I just have so much trouble sleeping. ; Patient: As I told you before, it's just, it doesn't matter how tired I am, I can't sleep. ; Patient: But it's just, I go in the morning, you know, 8 to noon, but then in the afternoon, it's just like, it's so hard to keep going on. ; Patient: It's just such a long amount of time and I just feel like, I don't know if I can really do it. ; Patient: Especially in the winter, you know, if you work 8 hours, by the time you get out of work, it's dark out and it just makes my depression so much worse. ; Therapist: So the latter part of the day is more of a struggle for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: The latter part of the work day. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, getting up in the morning, getting to work on time, you do okay with that? ; Patient: It's hard, it's hard, but I feel like I'm better at that. ; Patient: I'm better at it. ; Patient: I'm already up anyway, so, you know, I know I gotta get up, I gotta do what I have to do. ; Therapist: So the work program you're in now, you work in the morning? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What hours are you there? ; Patient: 8 to noon. ; Therapist: 8 to noon, okay. ; Therapist: And there's some work you have to do in the afternoon? ; Patient: Well, yeah, when, since I've been there for, uh, what is it, 8 weeks, and I haven't found a job yet, they want us to volunteer in the afternoon, and they find us our own place to volunteer, so that's good. ; Patient: I don't have to find that myself, but I guess they want to get you used to doing something for 8 hours a day and maybe have something to put on your resume. ; Patient: I guess when you have like a big gap in your resume, that doesn't look good either, so I'm also being able to say I worked here even though I didn't make money, but just thinking about it, it's so exhausting, and, you know, if I get out of the work program and I think if I had to go to, I can barely make it home, it's just so, all I want to do is go home. ; Therapist: Thinking about it's exhausting. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Can you tell me what type of thoughts you're having? ; Patient: I just don't think I can do it, like, I just don't think I'm the kind of person that can work 8 hours a day, and it just makes me feel like, what's the point? ; Patient: Like, I'm going to work 8 hours a day? ; Patient: I don't think I can. ; Therapist: It's just too many hours. ; Patient: Yeah.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Music ; Therapist: Hi Julie, how are you? ; Patient: Hi, I'm good thanks. ; Therapist: I'm Natasha, welcome to the service. ; Patient: Nice to meet you Natasha. ; Therapist: Nice to meet you too. ; Therapist: Do you want to have a seat? ; Therapist: Thank you for coming today. ; Therapist: How did you get here? ; Therapist: Did you travel by car or train? ; Therapist: How did you find the traffic? ; Patient: Yeah, I drove today and the traffic wasn't too bad actually. ; Patient: I got here in about 15 or 20 minutes. ; Therapist: Oh, that's good. ; Therapist: I was held up. ; Therapist: There was a big smash on the road so it took me a little bit longer. ; Therapist: So I'm glad that you were able to make it in. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: Julie, I'm glad that you've made the effort to come in today. ; Therapist: How did you hear about our service? ; Patient: Well, I was talking to a friend and saying that I thought I might benefit from having a chat to somebody. ; Patient: And she told me that one of her friends had actually come to your service before and said that it was very good. ; Therapist: Excellent. ; Therapist: Well, thank you for coming in. ; Therapist: When you came in, you filled out some forms, which the girls have given me, which is great. ; Therapist: So that gives me a little bit of a background to where you're from and things of that nature. ; Therapist: And I just wanted to start by saying that our service is a counselling service for women. ; Therapist: And therefore you fit that category, which is really good. ; Therapist: Now, I just wanted to let you know that this is our first initial interview, I guess. ; Therapist: So today we will be just setting some, I'll be hearing some of your story. ; Therapist: And we'll work through a little bit of a process. ; Therapist: And then I'm sure we'll get the opportunity to meet again. ; Therapist: Is that okay? ; Patient: That sounds good. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Excellent. ; Therapist: Now, within the pack that I've given you, or the girls at the front have given you, Julie, there is some information on how we keep your privacy and confidentiality. ; Therapist: So I just wanted to clarify that before we go into our session today. ; Therapist: So within the community centre here, we do, everything that you say to me today is kept within a confidential environment. ; Therapist: However, I am a mandatory reporter, which means that if you tell me something that I feel that you may be at risk, or you may be at risk of harm to yourself or hurting someone else. ; Therapist: If you have children, if they may be at risk, or if you're participating in illegal activity, I am a mandatory reporter, and I will need to let somebody know about that so that we can try to get you some help and assistance in dealing with that particular situation. ; Therapist: Is that okay? ; Patient: Yes, that's fine. ; Patient: I understand. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Excellent. ; Therapist: So Julie, let's just start by, what has brought you here today? ; Patient: Well, my husband and I have been fighting on and off the last couple of months, and I'm just noticing that we can't seem to come to any agreement lately. ; Patient: I'm losing sleep, I'm feeling exhausted, and I'm at a point where I feel like I might like to leave the marriage. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How long have you been married for? ; Patient: We've been together for eight years. ; Therapist: Oh, wow. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's a decent amount of time. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And do you have any children? ; Patient: Yes, we have three children. ; Patient: I have two little ones that are under five, and we have a seven-year-old who's at school. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you must be kept busy then? ; Patient: I'm always very busy. ; Patient: There's just always so much to do, and I'm really feeling very tired. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And the children today, whereabouts? ; Therapist: Who's looking after them today for you? ; Patient: Well, my two younger children today are being cared for by my mum, and my oldest one is at school today. ; Therapist: Excellent. ; Therapist: And where's your husband today? ; Patient: He's gone to work. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: So it seems as if you're at a point in your marriage where you're feeling as if the marriage has changed a little bit, and it's focused, and you're kind of a little bit worried about what the future holds for yourself and your husband. ; Patient: I am. ; Patient: I feel now that I can't come to any solution with the problems, and he's been drinking a lot, and he always enjoyed a social drink when we first got married, but I'm noticing now that he's drinking more and more. ; Patient: He seems to be drinking most days of the week, and when he does drink, he's very, very difficult to talk to. ; Therapist: So the alcohol seems to be a problem. ; Therapist: Do you think that might be relating to the changing behaviour that you mentioned earlier? ; Patient: Yes, I do. ; Patient: I think that the drinking has definitely changed his behaviour significantly, and he's very unreasonable, and he has a very short fuse. ; Patient: He's very, very easy to make angry over the smallest of things. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So that must be difficult for you and the children. ; Therapist: Have you noticed if the children have picked up on the change in his behaviour? ; Patient: Well, he does have a very good relationship with the children, and he actively participates in their daily lives, and the children haven't mentioned anything to me, and they don't seem to have changed their behaviour in any way. ; Patient: The arguments don't tend to happen in front of the children either. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Are the arguments something that... ; Therapist: Is it over more trivial things, or are there big, key things that you're kind of arguing with him about? ; Patient: Well, the arguments can start over something small. ; Patient: It can be just a simple argument over a task in the house. ; Patient: That can escalate into an argument about his family, or about my mother, or about money issues, and it just seems to escalate out of control. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So, Julie, have you... ; Therapist: In terms of his drinking, I'm kind of just trying to ascertain maybe what has developed in your marriage that's taken you to the point that potentially, you know, you've come to see me today. ; Therapist: And it appears as if the drinking is really the focus of perhaps your feeling of, you know, wanting to disconnect from the marriage and feeling isolated within the marriage. ; Therapist: Would that be right? ; Patient: That's true. ; Patient: That's right. ; Patient: I think the drinking is my main issue with his behaviour, and I think the drinking is greatly contributing to the way that he's behaving towards me. ; Therapist: Have you spoken to him about this? ; Patient: I have. ; Patient: I've tried to talk to him about the drinking a couple of times, and he just gets very, very defensive with me. ; Therapist: Potentially he's not acknowledging then that he may have a drinking problem. ; Patient: That's true. ; Patient: That's correct. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: I can understand that this must be difficult for you, Julie, and I'm pleased that you've come here today to try to, you know, work through some of these issues. ; Therapist: Now, Julie, in terms of, I guess, your commitment to the marriage, in terms of where you want the marriage kind of to go, do you think that you have a strong base that you can potentially, you know, if we were able to help your husband with the drinking side of things, that your marriage itself might be strong enough to overcome and to move forward in the relationship? ; Therapist: Or, you know, tell me a little bit about what your thoughts are with that. ; Patient: Well, I'm hopeful that we could resolve the issues that we're having, and although at the moment I feel like I need to break away from him, if he was able to get the support that he needed and we were able to get the support together, I think that I would be willing to give the marriage an opportunity to continue and to resolve our issues. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Julie, in terms of your own support, you mentioned your mum's looking after the children today. ; Therapist: Do you... Would you consider yourself to have friends and family that you... ; Therapist: You know, have you spoken to anyone else about this issue? ; Patient: Well, I have. ; Patient: I spoke to my girlfriend who recommended your service, and she's a very good support to me and to the children. ; Patient: And I have a very supportive family network as well. ; Patient: I have sisters who live in Sydney and also my mum, so they're all around me and they're very, very caring towards me. ; Therapist: Have any of those... ; Therapist: Any of the family or friends noticed a change in your husband's behaviour? ; Patient: Yes, they have. ; Patient: Actually, recently we had a social function and my brother did comment to me on how much alcohol my husband consumed at this social event. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So this is impacting on you as well as the, I guess, the extended family as well. ; Therapist: Well, it's really good to hear that you do have a support network outside of this room, I guess, which is really, really good. ; Therapist: And it's great that you've got that, and I'd encourage you to use your mum and your family and friends, you know, as a gentle ear to listen, to, you know, to help you support yourself and the children through this phase or this stage in your relationship with your husband. ; Therapist: So, Julie, I'm just trying to think about potentially... ; Therapist: Just to recap, so you're saying that your relationship with your husband has changed from what it was. ; Therapist: You've been with him for about eight years and you have got three children. ; Therapist: You've mentioned that the primary changes his behaviour and that you believe that it probably is linked to his change in drinking habits. ; Patient: That's right. ; Therapist: And from what I understand, you've expressed that you would be happy to potentially work with him to resolve or seek help for him in relation to his drinking habits. ; Therapist: How old do you... Would that be right in what I've said there? ; Patient: Yes, that's right. ; Patient: That's correct. ; Patient: I would be happy to work on things if he was willing to do that as well. ; Therapist: Not knowing your husband, I guess I would probably need to ask you if... ; Therapist: Do you think that your husband would be receptive to maybe some marriage counselling or going to see somebody about his drinking? ; Therapist: Is he the type of person that might be receptive to that or...? ; Patient: I think he would. ; Patient: I think if I was able to approach him when he was calm and relaxed, I think that, yes, he probably would be receptive to that. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: That's positive. ; Therapist: That's really good, because some people that I meet, you know, the answer to that would be quite different. ; Therapist: So I think that's really positive for you, Julie. ; Therapist: I think what we probably need to look at now is maybe continuing this relationship between you and I. ; Therapist: So I'd love to see you again and meet up with you again. ; Therapist: But also, too, I think we probably need to explore that avenue of either getting you some marriage counselling or something along those lines, as well as seeing whether or not your husband might be interested in looking at some services to help him with his drinking issues that he has. ; Therapist: So if it's OK by you, what we might do from here is organise for us to meet again. ; Therapist: What time is best for you? ; Patient: Around this time is a good time for me, and any Thursday or Friday during the day is good. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So what we'll do is we'll organise maybe for this time next week, and we'll meet again. ; Therapist: But in the meantime, I think we probably need to put you in contact with a relationships counsellor, and we'll try to get that side of things going. ; Therapist: And as a result of that, we'll be able to work out how receptive your husband is of potentially seeking some help for him as well. ; Therapist: I would like to just say that you mentioned that you probably would like to escape a little bit from it at the moment. ; Therapist: So perhaps I might be able to give you some advice or some information on some things that you might be able to do to take yourself away from that situation. ; Therapist: If you feel as if it's a little bit too much, maybe you might like to tap into your mum or your family and friends as well if you don't feel comfortable using some of the other services in the area. ; Therapist: How do you feel about that? ; Patient: That would be good. ; Patient: I'd appreciate that. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Well, thank you, Julie, for taking the time. ; Therapist: I'm really happy that you were able to come in today, and I look forward to going on this journey with you. ; Therapist: It's not a solution. ; Therapist: We can't fix everything here today. ; Therapist: It will be a process. ; Therapist: But hopefully together we can see a really positive outcome for you and your family. ; Patient: Thank you very much for talking to me today. ; Patient: That's been great. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: And I look forward to seeing you next week. ; Patient: Thank you very much.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: I just want to change gears again. ; Therapist: I want to talk about any potential trauma or abuse. ; Therapist: Are you comfortable with that topic? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You mentioned earlier that there have been no occasions where you've had non-consensual sexual contact. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: What about physical abuse? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How about emotional abuse? ; Patient: I don't know if it really counts as emotional abuse. ; Therapist: Well, tell me. ; Patient: My dad can be really intense about things and when you don't necessarily meet his expectations or bring home the grade he was expecting or if you're not as successful as your sister, he can be kind of harsh. ; Therapist: Can you give me an example of something he might have said? ; Patient: Why can't you ever be good enough? ; Patient: Or don't tell people you're my daughter or we go out in public. ; Patient: Or I wish we had two of your sisters and didn't have you. ; Patient: Or they also switched you at the hospital because you couldn't possibly be part of this family. ; Therapist: That sort of thing. ; Therapist: Fairly strong statements. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What's that feel like when he says things like that? ; Patient: I guess now I'm used to it. ; Patient: Before it was terrible but you just kind of grow numb to stuff like that. ; Therapist: You feel like you're numb to it now? ; Patient: I've heard it enough that I know it's coming so you just kind of get used to it. ; Therapist: Still got to be a little painful. ; Patient: Yeah, it is. ; Patient: But you can only hear things so many times before it's like, all right, well, you're hearing the same stuff. ; Therapist: Has there ever been a change in your anxiety levels or your drinking when he would make comments like that? ; Patient: Sometimes. ; Patient: He got off on a tangent or whatever and got really insulting. ; Patient: Generally I would need to blow some steam and then go out with my friends or whatever. ; Patient: And I think that's when it started to get into the heavier drinking during that time because I would get anxious and stressed out and not thinking clearly. ; Therapist: Would you consider this a significant part of your history? ; Patient: I guess so. ; Therapist: It seems a little upsetting to you, to say the least. ; Patient: Yeah, it is. ; Therapist: Something maybe we can talk about later? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So I want to switch gears again a little bit. ; Therapist: What do you do for fun, for recreation? ; Patient: Other than partying? ; Patient: Well, okay, I'll put that in there. ; Therapist: Partying, that's one thing. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay, yeah, so other than that? ; Patient: I like to shop. ; Therapist: Like to shop? ; Patient: And I like to hike in the mountains. ; Therapist: Hiking? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: When's the last time you were hiking? ; Patient: Two years ago. ; Patient: It's been a while. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What else? ; Patient: I like being out with my friends. ; Patient: I like going to see live shows, like music stuff. ; Therapist: Okay, live shows? ; Therapist: Like theater or? ; Patient: Like music, like bands and stuff. ; Therapist: Okay, like music. ; Therapist: When's the last time you've done that? ; Patient: Probably a year. ; Therapist: A year. ; Therapist: Do you consider your life to be fun? ; Patient: Not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Has it ever been? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I can think of instances that were fun. ; Patient: I don't know if I would call my entire life situation fun. ; Therapist: When was the last instance that you could remember? ; Patient: Like when I go out with my friends and blow up steam. ; Patient: That's fun. ; Therapist: So these little moments here and there? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But consistently, not the case? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I want to switch gears again and ask you about any type of, or any time in your life when you may have had suicidal thoughts or behaviors. ; Therapist: Have you ever had a time when you contemplated suicide? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Never? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And right now, it's not something you're thinking about? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: What do you think has protected you against having any type of suicidal thoughts? ; Patient: I want to succeed. ; Patient: I want to do more. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Now how about harm to others? ; Therapist: Have you thought about harming someone else? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Never? ; Therapist: What do you think protects you against that? ; Patient: I think I'm definitely a nice person. ; Therapist: Nice person? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you ever get angry? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Who doesn't? ; Therapist: Do you ever translate to anything where you had any desire to hurt anybody? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: So you deal with anger pretty well? ; Patient: I think so, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, good. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Again, some of these questions I'm aware of probably don't apply, but I want to go through them just in case. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Has there ever been a time where you heard or saw something that other people did not hear or see? ; Patient: Like a hallucination? ; Therapist: Like a hallucination? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Other than perhaps some of the influence of alcohol, was there ever a time you felt out of touch with reality? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How would you describe your judgment? ; Therapist: You make decisions. ; Patient: When I'm sober or when I am? ; Therapist: When you're sober. ; Patient: I think it's pretty good. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Good judgment? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean my anxiety plays into it a little bit. ; Patient: But I think generally it's good. ; Therapist: And when you're under the influence? ; Patient: Not as good. ; Therapist: Not as good? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Any questions for me so far? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I've been asking a lot of questions, huh? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I know. ; Therapist: We're almost through. ; Therapist: I appreciate you bearing with me. ; Therapist: I'd like to talk about your goals. ; Therapist: And I want to talk about on two levels. ; Therapist: So your goals in life, so these are like your general goals, and then your specific goals for your time with me. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So let's start with your general goals for your life. ; Therapist: What would you like? ; Patient: I want to get a job when I graduate. ; Patient: I want to be self-sufficient. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I like to not be so worried all the time. ; Patient: I just be kind of more at ease in general. ; Patient: Maybe get my own apartment, live on my own, that type of thing. ; Therapist: Live on your own? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Any other life goals? ; Therapist: Any goals surrounding family or anything like that? ; Patient: Maybe figure out how to communicate better with them, I guess. ; Therapist: How about having your own family? ; Patient: Yeah, for sure. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If you think of any other goals later on, or answers to these questions in any nature, feel free to just add that in, okay? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So we can go back and edit this and add to it. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about goals for treatment? ; Patient: The drinking is one. ; Patient: The anxiety. ; Patient: Anxiety. ; Patient: Maybe try to graduate. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Graduating college? ; Patient: Yeah, getting through this last year. ; Therapist: What was that last part? ; Patient: Just getting through the last year. ; Therapist: Oh, yeah, surviving the last year of college. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Drinking, anxiety, graduating college. ; Therapist: Anything else that would be a goal of therapy? ; Patient: I think those are the big ones I'm really concerned about. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So if you could meet those three goals, you feel like the counseling would have been successful? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So one last area I want to cover with you. ; Therapist: What do you consider your strengths that are going to help you to meet these goals and to meet your life goals? ; Patient: I think I'm ready now. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You're ready? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: What else? ; Patient: I think I'm dedicated to getting better and dedicated to the future that I want. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: I'm a hard worker. ; Patient: I don't know that I would have made it this far if I wasn't, despite everything else. ; Therapist: Hard worker. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: I think I'm pretty understanding. ; Therapist: Understanding? ; Therapist: How about intelligent? ; Patient: I guess so, yeah. ; Therapist: You guess so? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I never really thought about it. ; Therapist: Never thought about it. ; Therapist: How about social skills? ; Patient: I think I'm good at maintaining my friendships. ; Therapist: Do you think about the future a lot? ; Therapist: What are your futures going to be like? ; Patient: Sometimes. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how does it look to you right now? ; Patient: Not the way I want it to look. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, we'll try to work on that. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Are there any other questions that you want to ask me before we wrap up intake? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Patient: That was a lot. ; Therapist: What's that? ; Therapist: That was a lot. ; Therapist: I don't think that was a lot. ; Patient: That was a lot. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: We did cover a lot. ; Therapist: As I mentioned, if you have any other questions about this at any time, we can come back and revisit this. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: We can add on to it. ; Therapist: And likely as we go through the sessions, I'll have even more questions. ; Therapist: Maybe not as intensely packaged all at one time like this was, but I'll have more questions for you. ; Therapist: And I appreciate you answering the questions. ; Therapist: I know some of them are probably a bit challenging to talk about. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So I'm going to finish this up and I'm going to get you scheduled to see it in about a week. ; Therapist: Does that work for you? ; Patient: Yeah, of course. ; Therapist: And we'll get started with the counseling sessions. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right, Sam. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Patient: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: So Charles, it sounds like things have been going pretty well recently. ; Patient: Well, they've been going better. ; Patient: Yeah, they have. ; Patient: I did call a friend and we had lunch. ; Patient: I hadn't seen this guy in two or three years and it was good to see him. ; Patient: We contacted again and agreed we'd maybe have lunch from time to time. ; Patient: I got back in the kitchen. ; Patient: I made this pretty good soup. ; Patient: It's an asparagus potato soup. ; Therapist: That sounds great. ; Patient: It's really good. ; Patient: You chop up the asparagus and the potatoes and one small onion and boil them. ; Patient: Then use a blender to give it a real nice texture. ; Patient: Texture a little bit like split pea soup. ; Therapist: Sounds good. ; Patient: Without the split peas. ; Patient: I'm feeling some better. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: I'm proud of you for taking the initiative. ; Therapist: I know it's been difficult in the past. ; Therapist: You've really championed the things we've talked about. ; Therapist: I'm really proud of you for that. ; Therapist: One thing you did mention was the woodworking shop that we've talked about in the past. ; Therapist: How's that been? ; Patient: Well, that's still a mess. ; Patient: In fact, it's a big mess. ; Patient: It's such a mess that I really can't get in there and do any work. ; Patient: I haven't done that for some time. ; Patient: Every surface, I've got two workbenches and a bandsaw. ; Patient: Every surface has got tools and scraps of wood and plans. ; Patient: Paper plans or instructions. ; Patient: That sort of thing. ; Patient: I did not get into that. ; Therapist: As we've talked about in the past, it's really difficult to get started on some things that we've avoided for quite some time. ; Therapist: In the past, let's brainstorm and try to figure out how we can get some movement in the woodworking shops. ; Therapist: That sound good? ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: One thing we've discussed in the past, Charles, that's extremely important is what you're thinking about as you're going into the woodworking shop. ; Therapist: What are your thoughts when you are viewing or looking at the woodworking shop? ; Patient: When I stand there, I feel helpless. ; Patient: It's hopeless, it seems to me, to get it back in shape again. ; Therapist: Let's explore that. ; Therapist: What's the evidence that it's hopeless to do some work in the woodworking shop? ; Patient: Just the mess that it is. ; Patient: How disorganized. ; Patient: Sometimes if I need a tool to do something else in the house, I can't find the tool. ; Patient: I know it's in there, I just don't know where it is. ; Patient: A screwdriver, for example. ; Patient: It takes longer to find it than it's worth taking the time. ; Therapist: It sounds like you're saying it's disorganized and it's a mess. ; Therapist: How do you feel when you think about the woodworking shop that way? ; Patient: Hopeless, I think. ; Patient: I give up on it. ; Therapist: So it prevents you from actually getting things done is what you're saying? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Which makes sense because if I thought about it that way too, Charles, it would be hard for me to initiate any kind of action because if I view it as overwhelming, then I'm probably not going to do anything. ; Therapist: Which makes sense. ; Therapist: So what do you think is an alternative way to view the woodworking shop that would actually be helpful? ; Therapist: What's another way? ; Patient: Well, if I could get one workbench cleaned off, I would have some space to work on. ; Therapist: That's a really good start. ; Therapist: What would that lead to if you had some space to work on? ; Patient: I could make some things that I've been thinking about making for some time. ; Patient: I have the plans in my head. ; Patient: I've thought about a small medieval catapult for my grandson. ; Patient: Maybe a boomerang made out of really nice laminated wood. ; Therapist: That would be cool. ; Patient: So I could get one or both of those built perhaps. ; Therapist: What would that lead to if you got those things built? ; Therapist: Would you have to do anything with those things? ; Patient: Well, if I built those, I would have to get in the car and drive four hours to where my grandkids are and to give them the toys and show them how it works. ; Patient: I'd have to show them how to throw the boomerang. ; Patient: I would spend time with them. ; Therapist: So it sounds like there's a lot of benefit then to clearing out a bench and moving tools which would lead to you getting things done, especially things that would involve your grandkids. ; Therapist: So you'd be able to see them and spend time with them. ; Therapist: You'd feel better about going to do that, but you'd also feel better about the woodworking shop in general. ; Therapist: Is that basically what you're saying? ; Patient: I would, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: But as we've talked about in the past, Charles, I know that it still takes steps to get there. ; Therapist: That wouldn't change overnight. ; Therapist: So I think one useful strategy is for you and I to work on a step-by-step plan that would get us to the place of you being able to drive four hours to see your grandkids. ; Therapist: So how about we talk about the first step, which sounds like would be to just move things off one bench. ; Therapist: Does that sound right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: One, I'd have to start by moving one thing off of that bench. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Which means I'd have to have a place for it to go. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And once I did that, I could move a second thing off. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So that sounds great. ; Patient: Though sometimes when I think about moving one thing off and it has to have a place to go, I feel like maybe I should build something to make, give it a place to go. ; Patient: And that's another problem. ; Patient: The paper is no problem. ; Patient: I've got a shelf with some woodworking books on it and I could put the plans and the instructions on the shelf. ; Patient: I could pick one place in the shop where I'm going to put the wood scraps. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So let's talk about that then. ; Therapist: Let's sketch out what each day would look like so that we won't feel overwhelmed like we did in the past. ; Therapist: So let's talk about each day and how we would sketch out each day. ; Therapist: Does that sound good? ; Therapist: Sure.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hey Lisa, How are you doing today? ; Patient: Good, how are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well, thanks for asking. ; Therapist: How has the anxiety been going? ; Patient: Since last session it seems to be in check. ; Patient: Nothing really major has been going on with it. ; Patient: I think I'm getting to a point where it's under control. ; Therapist: It's subsided a bit? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: That's good. ; Therapist: How has things been going at work lately? ; Patient: Work is a little bit of a different story. ; Patient: We have our daily meetings. ; Patient: I actually had to pull one of my coworkers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. ; Patient: They don't give me the respect that I deserve. ; Patient: I took her outside after the meeting and laid into her about it. ; Patient: Afterwards, the next day, because we have these meetings every day, she came back and came at me again. ; Patient: But it was worse, even after talking to her. ; Therapist: So talking to her, that didn't improve your situation? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: So , You have these daily meetings. ; Therapist: You mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. ; Therapist: Something to that effect. ; Therapist: Tell me about that belief. ; Therapist: Remember we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences in REBT. ; Therapist: Tell me about that belief. ; Patient: I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. ; Therapist: Are there levels of respect? ; Therapist: Is there a certain level of respect that you demand or need? ; Patient: I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like I deserve it. ; Therapist: What did she do that convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect? ; Patient: She was shooting down my ideas and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. ; Patient: So I just didn't understand. ; Therapist: So she had criticisms of your ideas. ; Therapist: A few of them, it sounds like. ; Therapist: That would upset anybody. ; Therapist: But were those criticisms unusual given the tone of these meetings? ; Therapist: Is this a type of meeting where people criticize each other or attempt to in a constructive way? ; Patient: I mean, I guess. ; Therapist: Have you criticized other coworkers? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits, like within what you've kind of seen there regularly? ; Patient: I mean, now that you point it out, I mean, I guess I can view it in that way, that it wasn't... ; Therapist: It wasn't too far out of line the first time, right? ; Therapist: But then after you talked to her, you said that it got worse. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick, if you will. ; Therapist: Trying to get at you a little bit. ; Therapist: So maybe the second time around, correct me if I'm wrong, maybe she was actively showing you disrespect just because of what you had done, because you came after her and... Or was that within normal limits too? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, I guess I may have gone at her a little harshly, but I felt at the time that it was reasonable. ; Therapist: At the time when you were... ; Patient: When I was talking to her outside of the meeting. ; Therapist: So you felt that she was a bit harsh, you talked to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. ; Therapist: So where do you stand with her now, like with the meetings and such? ; Patient: Well, I've just been trying not to talk to her. ; Patient: And obviously in a work situation, it doesn't really help. ; Therapist: That's not convenient. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: It might not help. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So let's work this through using the ABC model that we used for the anxiety that you had before. ; Therapist: That was troublesome to you before. ; Therapist: What would the activating event be here in this situation? ; Patient: So I guess the confrontation I had with her. ; Therapist: Well, you could look at that as an activating event. ; Therapist: Another way to look at it is her criticism of you could have been the activating event. ; Therapist: And your conversation with her could have been the consequence. ; Therapist: But these things are cyclical. ; Therapist: So it's sometimes hard to know where to cut in and put the A and the B and the C. ; Therapist: But let's just work it through with the activating event being what she said. ; Therapist: Let's just try that and see how that works out. ; Therapist: Would that be reasonable? ; Therapist: That could have been kind of what started it, was this criticism. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So then what would the belief... ; Therapist: So all activating events are filtered through our belief system. ; Therapist: So what would your beliefs be in that scenario? ; Patient: So she criticized me and I felt disrespected. ; Therapist: That's a feeling. ; Patient: And I feel, or my belief is that I deserve respect. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And that came first. ; Therapist: So you have the activating event, which is her criticism, processed through your belief, which is that you must have respect, you deserve respect. ; Therapist: You mentioned the feeling. ; Therapist: So tell me about the feelings. ; Patient: So that being upset and disrespected and, you know, aggravation. ; Therapist: It was aggravation. ; Therapist: Frustration. ; Therapist: So that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Therapist: The feeling, the frustration feeling, would be one of the consequences, like an ABC. ; Therapist: So you have the activating event, she criticizes you, your belief is that you deserve respect, and that clearly she violated that belief. ; Therapist: She didn't show you the respect that you deserved according to your belief system. ; Therapist: And then one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. ; Therapist: Were there any other consequences? ; Patient: Well, if we go forward, it's the kind of disarray, or the tension, I guess, now in the office. ; Therapist: So that's definitely a consequence. ; Therapist: I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence, though. ; Therapist: So you had that feeling of frustration, and what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over? ; Patient: Oh, well, I confronted her. ; Therapist: You confronted her. ; Therapist: So you have kind of those two consequences. ; Therapist: And that confrontation, it would appear, has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. ; Therapist: You could also think of it as a consequence, but like I said, this is cyclical. ; Therapist: So you see how the A and the B and the C, that paradigm, can fit in to what happened here at work for you. ; Therapist: Does that make some sense? ; Patient: It does. ; Patient: Yeah, and I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can visualize it going around like a carousel. ; Therapist: Sure, exactly. ; Therapist: So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed, or could be changed in the future, right? ; Therapist: Because we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. ; Therapist: So her criticism of you, there's no direct way to change that. ; Therapist: The consequence is a consequence. ; Therapist: So that leaves the belief system, which is the deserving respect. ; Therapist: One of the things we try to do in REBT is help people move from rigid thinking to more flexible thinking. ; Therapist: So kind of a rigid belief system would be, and not that you said it in this way, but I demand and deserve respect. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: At this particular level, and people aren't meeting it. ; Therapist: Would you say that's a fair? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect, right? ; Therapist: Respect's good, respect's healthy in work environments, certainly, but if you don't get it, you can still function. ; Therapist: And it's tough for you. ; Therapist: I can see that's tough. ; Therapist: Tell me about that. ; Patient: I mean, I understand what you're saying. ; Patient: I get it. ; Patient: I guess it's just kind of like the anxiety, with the anxiety we worked on. ; Patient: It's just getting there. ; Therapist: Are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's tough though. ; Therapist: As you mentioned, with the anxiety, it's just tough. ; Therapist: How long have you had this belief, kind of this mentality of, I deserve respect? ; Patient: Oh, gosh. ; Patient: Since I was like a teenager. ; Patient: So, a long time. ; Therapist: This has been a relatively persistent part of your life, this belief system. ; Therapist: So, changing it's going to be work. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, if you can apply a different philosophy, apply more flexible thinking the next time you're in a meeting. ; Therapist: She still criticizes you in the meetings? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, if you filtered that through a belief system, now your first urge might be, I would think, to be, I'm being disrespected again, right? ; Therapist: It probably comes on that way. ; Therapist: You kind of feel it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up. ; Therapist: So, that'll be your first physiological reaction, right? ; Therapist: An emotional reaction. ; Therapist: But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, which is, I'd like respect, but I can survive and function without it. ; Therapist: At some level, I can accept that I'm not going to get it all the time. ; Therapist: Are there other areas of your life where you do get respect? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: For my friends and my family, I feel like they give me, it's actually mutual respect. ; Patient: They give me respect, I give them respect. ; Therapist: So, that need, if that's a need, that's being met, right? ; Therapist: Maybe not by this one coworker, right? ; Therapist: So, maybe she's being disrespectful. ; Therapist: Or, as we talked about before, maybe that's the way you're interpreting it and she never really intended to be disrespectful because criticism is part of what happens in those meetings. ; Patient: True. ; Therapist: So, you don't, you know, I don't really know which is which and you may not either at this point. ; Therapist: So, what do you think would happen if you could take that criticism the next time it occurs and run it through that more flexible belief system? ; Therapist: What would be the consequences? ; Patient: Well, I think over time, if I learned to do that, first starting with inside of me, I wouldn't get that initial punch to the gut. ; Patient: And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. ; Patient: Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So, if you could filter through that belief system and it would help if it was constructive, that would help you filter it through that, to be at that belief system. ; Therapist: Functioning in the office would improve for you. ; Therapist: Stress would be reduced for you. ; Therapist: Ultimately. ; Therapist: Is there a way to kind of patch things up with this co-worker to maybe explain that you understand a little more about her criticisms and maybe just try to smooth things over? ; Patient: I think I'd be able to do that. ; Patient: I think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her if she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of talk it over with her. ; Patient: Maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting and she really didn't mean to undermine me, as I said. ; Patient: And then go from there. ; Therapist: So, I think a good way of gathering the information, meaning having a discussion with her, would be helpful because you may find that you really see things alike and it was just a disagreement in terms of her criticism and the way you interpret it. ; Therapist: Or she may have been trying to be critical and you'll know that too.You really can,t control someone else's behaviour but it would give you an idea of maybe what her intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions. Yeah? ; Therapist: So, I think it's a good way to sort out your own. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I certainly don't want our upper management to get involved and there be a bigger issue. ; Therapist: You don't want them to have to come and sort that out. ; Therapist: You can sort out your own. ; Therapist: And that would be a good application of coping skills and flexible thinking. ; Therapist: So, is that something you feel like you can try over the course of the next week? ; Patient: I will definitely try. ; Therapist: So, really our plan moving forward has a couple parts. ; Therapist: So, one would be spoon things over in a sense, discussing this with her, letting her know you're aware of what's going on and you want to try to resolve it. ; Therapist: And the second part would be trying to move a little bit away from the rigid, you know, I deserve respect to, I would like respect but I'll function adequately without respect from everyone. ; Therapist: I know that's tough. ; Therapist: That's going to be the challenge. ; Therapist: But this will be, this will give us good information and give you some practice. ; Therapist: Does it all make sense to you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's pretty clear. ; Patient: You explained it really well. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Therapist: So, let's work on those two, those two elements. ; Therapist: And next time you come in, we'll check in on those two and make any needed modifications to our strategy and we'll kind of move forward from there. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: That sound good? ; Patient: Sounds great. ; Therapist: Thanks Lisa. ; Patient: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm okay. ; Patient: How are you, Dr. Granday? ; Therapist: Not bad. ; Therapist: Thanks for asking. ; Therapist: What's been going on? ; Patient: There's not really a lot of change on the drug front. ; Patient: You know, the Adderall, I'm really struggling. ; Therapist: Still struggling with the Adderall? ; Patient: Yeah I'm not sure what to do because I know that, I mean, I'm having such a hard time with it, but when I don't have it, I'm just not functioning. ; Patient: I'm not able to get as much accomplished. ; Therapist: Alright, so, go ahead. ; Patient: Well, it's like it's always there too. ; Therapist: It's always available to you. ; Patient: It's always available, yeah, or so much of the time. ; Therapist: Alright, so you're having some mixed feelings about it though, I'm sensing. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, like I know I want to stop, I think. ; Therapist: You think you want to stop? ; Patient: Yeah, no, I do. ; Therapist: You do? ; Patient: Oh my God, see, I feel crazy, but I know it would be good if I didn't have it in my life. ; Therapist: But at the same time, it is in your life. ; Patient: And I don't know how to get out of that. ; Patient: I mean, the one thing, if I didn't live with my roommate, that would be one thing. ; Patient: I wouldn't be in the apartment all the time. ; Therapist: So, you find you have easier access to the Adderall when you're in the house or apartment with your roommate? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, if you physically weren't there, like with your roommate in that apartment? ; Patient: Yeah, like if I was, oh my God, living at home with my parents again, or even living with somebody else, I guess. ; Patient: Oh my God, don't move. ; Patient: What a hassle, but that's, I mean, that's the problem. ; Patient: It's just there. ; Patient: It's accessible. ; Therapist: So, you're kind of, it sounds like you're recognizing that maybe you don't have the willpower to stop taking the drug when it's right there in front of you. ; Patient: Maybe you're right. ; Patient: That's good. ; Patient: Because before I didn't really want to stop. ; Patient: And sometimes I want to stop. ; Patient: My mind will go back and forth. ; Patient: But for the most part, I would like to be without it. ; Patient: I really don't want to deal with this anymore. ; Therapist: So, mostly, so there's still some feelings where you want to use it, but mostly you would like to stop. ; Patient: Well, it makes it so easy to get stuff done. ; Patient: I mean, I just take a couple and boom, boom, boom. ; Patient: I mean. ; Therapist: So, there's some advantages for you. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Patient: And I'm so used to it, too. ; Patient: It's just comfortable. ; Therapist: It's comfortable and it allows you to be productive. ; Therapist: Are there any downsides to it? ; Patient: Well, yeah. ; Patient: When I don't have it, the crash, it's like a really bad crash. ; Patient: I'm not productive. ; Patient: You know, it's, and it's gotten worse than it used to be. ; Therapist: So, it's painful. ; Patient: Like, I need it. ; Patient: It's painful. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Patient: It feels like a trap. ; Patient: And I want out. ; Therapist: And one of the ideas you were having was, it sounded like potentially, was moving out. ; Therapist: Moving out of the apartment. ; Therapist: Because then you wouldn't have access to the, you wouldn't have access to the Adderall anymore. ; Therapist: Or it would be harder to get. ; Patient: Oh my God. ; Patient: Like, sometimes it's really weird. ; Patient: Sometimes it feels like that's a good idea and then sometimes I'm like, no, no. ; Patient: I don't want to be, you know, kind of cut off from it. ; Patient: But, I think I'm ready. ; Therapist: You think you're ready for that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that moving out, you really see is what you would need to do. ; Therapist: Because stopping while living there is too difficult. ; Patient: Oh my God. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, I think you're right. ; Therapist: I remember before you've tried to stop while living there a few times, right? ; Therapist: Or the last few months. ; Therapist: And with your roommate having it, with your roommate being the one that gives it to you, it just appears the temptation is so great for you. ; Patient: Yeah, she really doesn't get it. ; Patient: She doesn't understand, like, what a problem this is for me. ; Patient: She's definitely not supporting me or anything like that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: God, maybe it would be better. ; Therapist: Well, are there any disadvantages to living with your parents? ; Patient: Living with my parents at my age, it just feels like a little bit humiliating, a lot humiliating. ; Therapist: Okay, so humiliation would be one? ; Patient: Yeah, and just this feeling of failure, embarrassment. ; Patient: And then my mom just is in my business, you know. ; Therapist: So there's some clear disadvantages to moving into parents. ; Therapist: Any advantages other than the obvious, it would sever you from the adderall? ; Patient: My mom would do my laundry, fully stocked fridge. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, my dad will fill my gas tank up. ; Therapist: Are these things that happened before when you used to live there? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, not so bad. ; Therapist: So there's some disadvantages to this plan, but there's some advantages and there's a key advantage of being cut off from the adderall. ; Patient: Yeah, and it wouldn't necessarily have to be the rest of my life either. ; Therapist: Hmm. ; Patient: Just for now, just to get me out of that apartment with the drug, right? ; Therapist: That would separate you from the drug and you could potentially move out later on. ; Patient: Oh my God, do I want to? ; Patient: I mean, that's just it. ; Patient: It sounds really good until I really think about it. ; Therapist: So when you really think about it, what comes to mind? ; Patient: Oh, like I start to shake, like that feeling of, you know, when you really want something, you really want something and you can't get to it. ; Patient: And it's just that desperation that, and like right now, I know that I'm living there, it could be my choice. ; Patient: I could take it or I could not take it, you know, but at least when I want it, it's there. ; Patient: If I move out, I'm like making that decision for myself. ; Therapist: That's right, you would be. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: Is this tough? ; Therapist: Well, before it seemed like you were really more on the side of making this change than not. ; Therapist: But clearly there's still some things you want to consider. ; Patient: No, you know, you're right though. ; Patient: I want out. ; Patient: And it's not really a choice when I'm there. ; Patient: Like I say I have the choice, yes or no, but the choice is always yes. ; Therapist: You always end up using the Adderall. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, let me make sure I understand the situation overall. ; Therapist: You live with your roommate, she has Adderall, when she makes it available to you, you use it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You've tried to stop that behavior, but that's just not working for you. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, that's so clear. ; Patient: And I don't want to be using it. ; Therapist: You don't want to be using it, but yet you are, especially because the proximity. ; Therapist: Because you're right there and she has it and it's just tough for you to stop that behavior. ; Therapist: There's another possible decision, which is moving back home, which has some disadvantages and advantages. ; Patient: Yeah, that's true. ; Patient: God, it would be nice having that fully stocked fridge. ; Therapist: So, there's an upside to it that would be beyond just not using the drug, which in itself would be a big victory for you. ; Patient: Yeah, and my mom would be there to talk to, yeah. ; Therapist: So, let's do this. ; Therapist: It seems like that's the direction you're moving, right? ; Patient: Okay, yeah. ; Therapist: No pun intended with the word moving, but you're thinking that might be a better way to go. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, for the next session, let's plan out, and this wouldn't necessarily be doing anything, let's plan out the steps that you'd have to put in place to move back home. ; Therapist: Talking to your parents, whatever financial arrangement you have with your roommate, getting all your stuff out, the logistics of moving, let's just go through the steps. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And try to get a firm plan together. ; Therapist: And of course you can always reevaluate and change your mind. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right, but all we're doing at this point is just planning and seeing how it would look. ; Patient: This is kind of exciting. ; Patient: Is it exciting? ; Patient: Yeah, it definitely is. ; Patient: I can do that. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: So, I will see you next week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we'll pick up right where we left off, and we'll start with the planning, and we'll see what happens with that. ; Patient: Cool. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Thanks, Anne. ; Patient: Sure.",

; Patient: Yeah, I mean, good week with the roommate. ; Patient: I had a good conversation with her about like what times are good for boyfriend to be over and kind of giving her better heads up on when I really need silence. ; Therapist: Well, terrific. ; Therapist: So what was, what specifically, I mean, I know we've talked a lot about that, but what specifically did you say to her or how did you bring it up? ; Patient: I was just telling her that like my studies are really important and I understand like it's also important that she has time with her boyfriend, but that I would really appreciate that this is both our space and that there are times when like we really need to respect each other's space and yeah, she responded really well. ; Patient: She was like, just really give me a good heads up before you, yeah. ; Patient: And that we kind of decided like certain times are more appropriate for them to have the living room and not. ; Therapist: Right, right. ; Therapist: Yeah, because I think that's really similar. ; Therapist: I know we kind of talked about that and as I, you know, you remember like a few sessions ago, I was kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in terms of what you were feeling because it seems like one of the ways that you've, you know, we talked about that before in terms of like, you know, when we were first starting that oftentimes one of the ways that you manage your feelings is you kind of, you think you are letting people know what you're feeling, but it doesn't really come out. ; Therapist: And I know that it was something that you and I had to really like, you know, kind of work out, but it sounds like that you were able to talk with her and that she heard you and as I kind of thought that she was actually really responsive in a very positive way. ; Patient: I think being a little more direct was helpful. ; Therapist: It's really nice. ; Therapist: It's really nice. ; Therapist: Well, I think too, you've been able to do that more with me and I feel like that, I feel like that's been really helpful. ; Therapist: I know they've been kind of pushing you on that and that's been hard, but I feel like it's been really nice because I feel like it's really been helpful with your relationship with Kathy. ; Therapist: So that's fantastic. ; Therapist: And also, you know, again, I know that I've keep, you know, like saying this over and over again, but you know, as you've worked on these things, it's been really notable that it's really had a nice and positive effect on your eating because it seems like it's really, you've really seen a lot of real nice improvements. ; Therapist: So awesome. ; Therapist: Anything else that, you know, so you had a really good conversation with Kathy, anything else going on this week? ; Patient: Yeah, I got to spend some time with Brooke. ; Therapist: Oh nice. ; Patient: I went home for two days and was with my mom and Brooke. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So is she still six or did she have a birthday recently? ; Patient: She's almost seven. ; Therapist: Oh, that's great. ; Therapist: Almost seven. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Any plans for birthday for her or what do you think she's going to do? ; Patient: She's really into frozen. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Anything frozen is good. ; Patient: Anything frozen is good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That sounds terrific. ; Therapist: And so then you spent some time with her. ; Therapist: I'm going to ask you a little bit more about your mom and how that felt positive for you. ; Therapist: Did you, when you were there, did you have any opportunity to visit with your mom or how did that go? ; Patient: I feel like my mom was around. ; Patient: Like we kind of all spent time together and like she asked about school and I was able to like tell her a little more about school and how things are going. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: We didn't really get like one on one time. ; Therapist: How did that feel for you in terms of like, you know, for her, I know that you talked about not really liking that she all of a sudden is deciding now that she wants to really be kind of like, you know, the good mother and kind of like be involved in your life. ; Therapist: But how is it for her to kind of like want to know how things have been going for you? ; Patient: I mean, I've kind of like allowed myself to tell her, I guess, how things have been going. ; Patient: But I mean, like to an extent, like it was like with Brooke and whatnot, like we didn't really sit down just us two together. ; Therapist: So kind of what we had discussed kind of that you've been, you've like, you've been allowing yourself to be more connected with her, but you're still kind of keeping up, keeping a little bit of a boundary. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, I'm sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything that's gone on, you know, with, you know, kind of the infidelity issue with your dad, or at least it's just, you know, kind of like the wondering about that. ; Therapist: I mean, I think you kind of know that that was probably what was going on. ; Therapist: But then, you know, and then moving you how harsh and critical she was issues with Brooke, you know, even I still even remember too for her to have gotten to the point where she wouldn't even let you like go to your grandmother's funeral or at least, you know, kind of. ; Therapist: So all those things have been so like, you know, front and center, you know, and so now to feel like that she's made this real dramatic shift and, you know, wanting to start being a mom. ; Therapist: But it sounds like that you're really working to try to manage that in a better way. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, like we still, butt heads a little bit. ; Therapist: I'm sure. ; Therapist: But yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: But when you do butt heads, what is it, how are you, what happens in terms of your eating when you guys kind of like, when you feel like that there's a little bit of a friction? ; Patient: I mean, I guess that's like kind of what leads back to things. ; Patient: Like things were really good this weekend for the most part. ; Patient: And then kind of when I was leaving, she just like, and they're just brought up things about wanting to know more about life and whatnot and what's going on at school and if I'm seeing ; Patient: anyone. ; Patient: Yeah, it's just, I'm like, we don't have that relationship. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: That felt really stressful. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: So I'd say like when I got back to school, like right after that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And she like called me. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, it makes a lot of sense because again, you know, like, I know that we've really reviewed this quite a bit, but you know, historically that's how it's been, you know, that that's really been a real, and it really clarifies why we're working on this is because it's so clear that when the two of you have like these rough patches that it really all of a sudden evokes all these like negative feelings and that's when food like really, you know, you know, kicks in. ; Patient: Yeah, she makes little comments though, like seeing what I'm wearing, like, ah, that looks ; Patient: cute. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So it's really hard to, you know, I can understand that it's really hard to let that go. ; Therapist: I mean, because obviously there's a lot of, lot of feelings that you have about that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: On the other hand too, it seems like that, you know, things have been going really well. ; Therapist: How have things been going in terms of just in general, like school, friendships, you know, anything else that's kind of on the horizon? ; Patient: Yeah, kind of seeing a guy. ; Therapist: Cool. ; Therapist: I won't get too excited about that, but tell me about him. ; Therapist: Tell me about him. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: You sound like my mother. ; Therapist: No, what's his, you have to at least give me his name. ; Therapist: What's his name? ; Patient: His name is Alan. ; Therapist: Alan. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, did you like, all right, I'm not going to blow this out of proportion, but how, how, how did that kind of come about? ; Patient: We had a class together and kind of went and studied at a coffee shop. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And then just kind of asked to like do a movie night and I was like chill and good. ; Therapist: Nice. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: No, like, yeah. ; Therapist: Nice. ; Patient: And I was like, oh, I'm really happy. ; Therapist: That's great. ; Therapist: So a lot of really nice things that are going on. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's terrific. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So then for you to go like from, you know, cause you know, we kind of got going with this thing. ; Therapist: It was kind of like you were full on binge eating, you know, virtually every day, sometimes twice a day. ; Therapist: And now to be down to, you know, three, like in the space of like, you know, you know, just like seven, eight weeks is pretty remarkable. ; Therapist: So now I'm really pleased with how hard you've been working. ; Therapist: Cause you've really been pushing yourself, you know, I really appreciate it. ; Therapist: And I know this stuff with your mom is particularly hard. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's been really hard for you. ; Patient: I guess like not being able to, like, I don't feel comfortable really telling her yet about. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And you may not, you know, I mean, it's like, you know, I know that we talked about, there's like, maybe there are times when you just don't really want to share some of that stuff, you know, and, and I think sometimes my experience has been some parents, like, you know, the goal is not to make her feel bad. ; Therapist: If you would want to share it, you'd want to share it knowing that she would hold onto that and keep it and really connect with you around it and want to be helpful rather than like, like, Oh yeah, you were so mean to me. ; Therapist: Now I have an eating disorder, you know, cause then that, that feels, you know, that doesn't feel quite right. ; Therapist: And I know that that's, you know, I know that you have a lot of hard feelings, but I don't really feel like that that's how you'd want that to go, you know? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And I know we've talked about it a lot, but how are things going with your dad? ; Patient: Good. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Good. ; Patient: He's doing well. ; Patient: Uh, hoping that he's coming up here to school to see me. ; Therapist: Oh nice. ; Therapist: When does he plan to visit? ; Patient: A couple of weeks. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Oh, nice. ; Therapist: That'd be really nice for you to spend time with him. ; Therapist: That's great. ; Therapist: That's really great. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So let's talk some more about this thing with your mom. ; Therapist: Cause I feel like that, I mean, I know it's tough, but I guess I've been thinking about this a lot. ; Therapist: And especially after last session that, that given the fact that, you know, you and Brooke are so close and it does feel like that your mom is, at least she seems like she's making, she's trying to make an attempt to connect with you. ; Therapist: Um, um, whether or not, you know, at what point would you feel like that you, well, what would you need from her in order to feel like that you could kind of like, maybe not let down the walls, but kind of soften those a little bit. ; Therapist: I mean, is there something, is there something that like, if you could ask her like, okay, mom, if you did this, then I would do this. ; Therapist: Not that you would do that, but I just wondered if like, what would you, ideally, what would you like to see in order to feel like that you could connect with her more? ; Patient: I mean, like, I wish she really recognized like kind of the pressures that she put on me back in the day. ; Patient: Um, yeah. ; Patient: And just like now to just, I don't know, just kind of be there in the moment instead of like trying so hard to like, I don't know, cause things still come out. ; Patient: Like she still makes her little comments about things. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I know we talked about this, but have you gotten to the point yet where you felt like that you could like even let her know that, that, that puts a lot of pressure on you or that the comment that she makes kind of hurt your feelings? ; Therapist: Cause I know that in the moment you feel it. ; Therapist: Um, but what would it be like for you if you were to just like, yeah, say like, you know, I, I know that you're, I know that you mean well, I mean, maybe she doesn't, but maybe it's sometimes important to approach that way, but it really hurts my feelings or, you know, I feel like that that really puts a lot of pressure on me to look a particular way. ; Patient: And, you know, so I mean, I am seeing that I like starting to see that she does mean well. ; Patient: Uh, yeah, but yeah, I guess I could definitely get to that point of being able to really express that to her. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Cause I know that you did that. ; Therapist: You've done that with your roommate. ; Therapist: I know there've been other times when people have done that because I know that that's been kind of part of the bigger issue is just knowing what it is you're feeling and also being able to kind of give voice to that. ; Therapist: And you know, I was thinking about that relationship with your mom because it does seem like that every once in a while she kind of like jabs you or she'll send something out and, and, and the way that you take it in is more like harsh, critical, you know, her and um, and I just don't know, like kind of like with Kathy when you finally talk with her, how it's like, it was like, it was like, Oh, of course. ; Therapist: Like, you know, uh, you know, I'll try to be more sensitive and I'm not really sure, you know, whether or not your mom would be, yeah, I mean, I guess that's something that she could do. ; Patient: I guess I worry that cause we've always been kind of defensive towards each other. ; Patient: I just worry that like that will happen again. ; Patient: I mean, I don't know, like it might not because of how things happen. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: But yeah, I guess I'm worried that, yeah. ; Therapist: Well, I think there are times too when I wonder if like, um, maybe if there's a time when you say something like, I know there've been times when you kind of snap back at her, you know, or you'll kind of like, you know, bark or kind of jab her a little bit. ; Therapist: Um, what if, you know, again, what if you thought about like, because it sounds like that you're really aware when you do that because you know that when she says something, you have a tendency to jab back, you could just say, you know, you know, I realized I was, that was a jab at you and I'm really sorry. ; Therapist: I'm aware that sometimes I kind of get really critical with you and I don't feel very good about that. ; Therapist: You know, I wonder how she would, you know, if that would, what that would do. ; Therapist: Maybe it wouldn't do anything or it may make you feel a little bit too vulnerable, but you think about it. ; Therapist: I mean, and, um, you know, kind of mull that over in your mind about what that might be like because my experience has been that sometimes, you know, I hate the phrase be a bigger person because I, you know, I didn't want that to come across that way, but sometimes in order to change relationships, somebody has to be willing to kind of like kind of be willing to do something just a little different. ; Therapist: And since it seems like you have a growing awareness of, you know, the re interactions that you have with her, I wonder if that might be worthwhile. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Mull it over and think about it and, um, and we'll keep talking about it. ; Therapist: Um, but yeah, it sounds like it was a really terrific week and, um, been working really hard and it really pays off because again, the more you've done that, we've seen real positive impact on your eating. ; Therapist: So nice. ; Therapist: Nice.",

; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you know what's causing it? ; Patient: Not really, I mean, it's just the same, except worse, you know, like I just, I feel like what's the point. ; Patient: I don't feel like continuing on. ; Therapist: You don't feel like continuing with your life? ; Patient: Yeah, kind of. ; Therapist: Have you been having thoughts of suicide? ; Patient: I mean, I think about what it would be like to just end things. ; Patient: I think it would be a lot easier, but at the same time, like, I can't imagine doing it, but, you know, I can't say I haven't thought about it. ; Therapist: You have had some thoughts about it. ; Therapist: What prevents you from doing it? ; Patient: I don't know, I mean, I guess I know what it would be like for my family. ; Patient: I don't want to hurt them. ; Therapist: And they would be hurt? ; Patient: Yes, and it's scary, I mean, the thought of dying is scary, but the thought of going on is painful. ; Therapist: So it almost sounds as if, you know, life's wearing you down a bit. ; Patient: Yeah, I kind of feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, like I just don't know where to go from here. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Have you worked out any specific plan to hurt yourself? ; Patient: No, I mean, you know, I've thought, like, if I were to do it, you know, ways, but not specific because I just don't think that I could do it, you know, like I don't, I've thought about suicide, but I don't, like, seriously consider it as an option, but it's starting to, like, creep into my thoughts. ; Patient: And it never has before, so I'm, like, kind of concerned about that. ; Patient: Like, I guess I know sometimes people, like, really plan it, but for me, I've never really considered it before, so it's really scary for me. ; Therapist: Alright, so, in this, how long has this been on, these feelings? ; Patient: I think, like, in the past couple of days, it started, you know, more so, and then, like, the day, it was just, like, the first thought in my head, and I couldn't stop thinking about it, and that's why I wanted to see you, because I'm just feeling, I'm starting to feel, like, a little bit out of control. ; Therapist: Okay, so, in today, and maybe the past few days, been kind of a new feeling that, a new thought, you don't want to continue life, you want to continue living, but at the same time, you don't want to commit suicide, you don't have a plan. ; Patient: Yeah, I don't want to, I really don't want to, but, you know, like I said, I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, like, it's not, I know it's not a good option, I just, like, sometimes I feel like I'm so stuck, I just don't know where else to go. ; Therapist: So if, we'll call it a feeling depression, right, because that's what we've talked about before, if the depression would go away, do you think that would change your outlook on? ; Patient: Definitely, I think that is, like, the reason why I, the reason why the thought of not living anymore comes into my head is because of my depression, because I just feel so, like, my emotions are out of control because I wake up feeling so down and so useless and pointless that it makes me wish that I was dead. ; Patient: But if I didn't have that feeling, then I wouldn't wish that I was dead, because I know that my life has value and I know that my family would want me around and I know there's a future for me, but my feelings make me feel like my future is just dark and pointless. ; Therapist: Alright, these suicidal ideations, I know you're telling me you haven't had them before, so I can appreciate that they're scary, they'd be scary even if you hadn't had them before, are fairly common with depression. ; Therapist: And you've, it sounds like what you're really saying is you're frustrated and you're tired of being sick. ; Therapist: And I think that you make a valid point when you say your family would be upset if anything happened to you, because we talked about your family before and it would seem to be very upset, right, so your life has value. ; Therapist: I want you to try to hang on to that thought. ; Therapist: After we're done here today, tell me what you have planned for us today. ; Patient: Well, I didn't really have plans because I kind of, you know, came here feeling like I really needed to see you, so I kind of put things on hold, but I mean, I guess I would go home and, you know, I'm not really sure. ; Therapist: Is anybody else at home? ; Patient: No, but I mean, I probably could go to my parents' house if I needed to, I could probably call them and see if, you know, it's getting close to the afternoon so they can get off work soon. ; Therapist: Can you do that for me? ; Therapist: Can you go there? ; Patient: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. ; Therapist: And we'll kind of play it by ear from that point. ; Therapist: I'm going to see you today, we'll do some work today, well I'll see you again tomorrow, alright, so if you could spend a night there, I think that would be a wiser choice given your thoughts and your feelings right now. ; Therapist: Have you ever had me use the term contract for safety? ; Patient: I think you mentioned it before, I'm not really sure. ; Therapist: Okay, so what it means is you kind of, and only if it's authentic, I want this to be true, it's kind of where you promised to me that you're going to be safe until I see you again, right, for the foreseeable future, that you don't have any intent or plan to harm yourself. ; Therapist: Can you make that promise to me now? ; Patient: I can. ; Therapist: Alright, so give me a minute and I'll come back and we'll work a little bit today and then I'm going to schedule you to see you tomorrow as well, okay? ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Alright, thanks Jill.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, Lucy. ; Therapist: Nice to meet you. ; Patient: Hi. ; Therapist: So I understand that you were referred here by your GP because you've been feeling quite down recently. ; Patient: Yeah, I thought I should. ; Patient: I've been feeling quite bad for quite a while. ; Patient: So I thought maybe it's time to see someone about it because I don't want to feel like this anymore. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So from your notes, I saw that you saw the GP about three months ago. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So how long have you been feeling down altogether? ; Patient: Quite a few months before that as well, actually. ; Patient: But it's gotten pretty bad these past few months. ; Patient: So that's kind of why I came. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So has it got worse since you saw your GP? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So tell me, how are things at the moment? ; Patient: Well, it kind of started just feeling a bit low and wound up about things. ; Patient: But I don't know, just recently I just can't really be bothered to do anything at all. ; Patient: I kind of find it hard to get motivated for things. ; Patient: And I want to be, I really want to be better, but it's just kind of reaching the end now where I just want to do something about it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you said that you're feeling really down, really sad. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you feel like you haven't got any motivation. ; Therapist: But are you okay? ; Patient: Yeah, I'm fine. ; Patient: Sorry. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And you haven't got any motivation, but it sounds like you put quite a lot of pressure on yourself to try and feel a bit better. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I just, it's kind of hard as well because there's not really anyone to talk about. ; Patient: So I just kind of stay on my own trying to, I don't like to think about it, but I don't know. ; Therapist: So you say you've been, you're feeling quite isolated. ; Therapist: There's not many people around. ; Patient: Yeah, there's no one I can talk to about it. ; Patient: No one would listen or understand anyway. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I'm just going to try and find out a little bit more about you. ; Therapist: So I understand that you're an English student at uni. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you live away from home with some friends. ; Therapist: Is that right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I live here. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you don't live far from the uni. ; Therapist: But you say you feel like you live with your friends, but you don't feel like you can talk to them. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, they're lovely. ; Patient: I get on really well with them, but I don't know. ; Patient: I just recently, whenever they want to go out or stuff, I just, I don't want to bring them down. ; Patient: I can't, they don't understand what I'm going through. ; Patient: They kind of, I don't know, they don't make fun of how I feel, but they don't really understand what it's like. ; Patient: I just, I don't want to go out with them and bring them down or stuff. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds, do you try and hide the way you're feeling from them? ; Patient: I guess. ; Patient: I mean, it's easier to hide it than to try and explain it all the time when no one really wants to know. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you've been feeling down. ; Therapist: You've been feeling unmotivated. ; Therapist: You feel like you want to be better, but actually it sounds like you feel like you can't reach out for help. ; Therapist: You can't speak to anybody. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I don't really talk to my parents a lot either. ; Patient: So that's kind of hard. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm just going to go back in time a little bit. ; Therapist: I suppose I'm just wondering when, when did all of this start? ; Therapist: You said it's been going on for quite a few months. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Um, I guess it kind of started, uh, when I was actually, when I was revising for my exams, um, I guess the stress, I put a lot of stress on myself. ; Patient: I think I've always wanted to do well for me and I guess for my parents. ; Patient: So the stress of exams and it was also kind of hard because my parents were going through a bit of a troubled time then. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So this would be like last March, last April? ; Therapist: Uh, yeah, I think so. ; Therapist: Around that time. ; Therapist: So about six months-ish. ; Therapist: And it sounds like a lot was happening. ; Therapist: So you had a lot of uni pressure on and, um, and you said that your parents were having marital problems. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And it sounds like that was a real shock to you. ; Patient: Yeah, I guess it was hard as well because I wasn't doing well at uni. ; Patient: I guess I just felt a bit guilty. ; Patient: I know it sounds silly, but I felt like maybe if I could do better, then they would get better. ; Patient: But it just wasn't really happening. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you were trying to work hard and be more successful because you thought that that would make them happier and try and fix things. ; Patient: Yeah, I wanted to make them feel better, but it just kind of backfired a little, I guess. ; Therapist: How did it backfire? ; Patient: It just ended up with them getting worse and I've just been feeling worse since then. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So after the summer, after the exam period, and how did that exam period go for you in the end? ; Patient: Not very well. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's an awful lot of pressure to put on yourself. ; Therapist: I suppose to think... ; Patient: It's just annoying because I know I should have done better and I just didn't. ; Patient: And I guess I beat myself up a lot about it. ; Therapist: So you say, I know, I know I should have done better. ; Therapist: I mean, I suppose hearing it from my perspective, I'm thinking it sounds like you had an awful lot going on at the time. ; Therapist: It'd be understandable, absolutely, that you wouldn't do as well as normal. ; Therapist: I suppose I'm just wondering if you have very high standards for yourself. ; Patient: Probably maybe more than other people. ; Patient: My parents have always kind of taught me, not in a loving way, I guess, but that you should do your best, but also get the best. ; Patient: And I agree with that. ; Patient: I think that's the right thing to think. ; Patient: But when I don't do that, I don't know. ; Patient: It annoys me a lot and I worry that it annoys them. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you feel you should always do your best. ; Therapist: Is that the word you used? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that there isn't any kind of exceptions for that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I can see then that that was a really difficult time for you. ; Therapist: And that was when your mood started to get lower and things are still quite bad now. ; Therapist: I mean, what's the situation with your parents at the moment? ; Patient: I think it doesn't sound good. ; Patient: I don't really talk to them a lot, but I don't think they're going through very good. ; Patient: I don't like to talk to them about it because it just makes me feel worse. ; Patient: But I don't think it's getting any better. ; Therapist: Were you home over the summer? ; Patient: For a little bit, yeah. ; Therapist: And how was that? ; Patient: Not very fun. ; Therapist: No. ; Patient: It was quite tense all the time. ; Patient: It stressed me out more than relaxed me over the summer, I guess. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds then like quite a lot has been happening. ; Therapist: You've been feeling very low. ; Therapist: You've had uni pressure on. ; Therapist: You've had problems with your parents' marriage. ; Therapist: And it sounds like you feel like you can't really reach out to anyone, like you can't understand, but you can't really reach out to your parents right now. ; Therapist: You can't really confide in your friends. ; Therapist: So I suppose I'm just wondering if you can tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling, I mean, say this past week. ; Patient: Really not good, to be honest. ; Patient: I actually, if I don't have to, then I don't really leave the house or get out of. ; Patient: But I just, I can't find the motivation for the things I used to join. ; Patient: I used to love doing sports or going out, and now I just prefer to lie and better not really do anything. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I missed a few lectures this week that I should have gone to, but... ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So I suppose I'm just wondering then, let's see if we can think about one thing, say a lecture. ; Therapist: What kind of thoughts do you have about going to that lecture before it happens? ; Patient: I don't really see the point anymore. ; Patient: If I can't do as well as I should be doing, then what's the point in putting myself in those positions? ; Patient: I just, I can't be bothered anymore to try. ; Patient: It just stresses me out more than I need to. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like the kind of thoughts you've got in your head are, it's pointless, it's not worth it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you have any other thoughts in your head when you're just at that point before you go to the lecture? ; Patient: I feel like, I don't know, I don't really even deserve to be here if I can't do well enough. ; Patient: I see all these other students who are doing well and doing better and want to be there. ; Patient: I don't know why I'm here even at uni, to be honest. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you feel like you're not as good as other people here. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm just, sorry, is it okay if I take notes as we go through? ; Therapist: It's just I'm trying to, I guess, understand what you're telling me and it helps me just to write it down and I'll share this with you later. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like those are some quite negative thoughts to have. ; Therapist: You're kind of saying, you know, it feels like it's pointless, it's more effort than it's worth, and I don't deserve to be here. ; Therapist: I mean, when you have those thoughts, how do you feel? ; Patient: Very unworthy probably would be the best way to put it, kind of, I don't know, lower than normal. ; Patient: Because then it makes me think about all the things that I should have been doing better. ; Therapist: Okay, so what you described there then, you said, I'm unworthy, I should be doing lots of things better. ; Therapist: Those are kind of what I would call thoughts, actually. ; Therapist: I suppose I'm trying to understand what it feels like in your gut. ; Therapist: What kind of emotions do you feel? ; Therapist: Happier? ; Therapist: Do you feel sad? ; Therapist: What kind of emotions are you feeling when you have those thoughts? ; Patient: Sad. ; Patient: Not happiness. ; Patient: No, sad. ; Patient: A bit of anger and frustration as well. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I know you're just kind of telling me this, and I know this is quite a heavy topic, but you're kind of laughing. ; Therapist: And I suppose I wonder a little bit, are you a bit, you know, how do you feel about having these emotions, talking about these emotions? ; Patient: I guess, embarrassed. ; Patient: I've never yet talked about it, so it's quite uncomfortable to be in this situation. ; Therapist: Okay, well you're doing a great job, because I know that this can be difficult. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like some of the thoughts you're describing are, it's pointless, it's more than it's worth, I don't deserve to be here, I'm unworthy. ; Therapist: And those kind of thoughts, it sounds like they just flip through your mind. ; Therapist: And then you're kind of describing different emotions that those lead to. ; Therapist: You're kind of describing sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed. ; Therapist: What about in your body, what happens? ; Therapist: How do you feel, kind of physically? ; Patient: I used to be, I think from those emotions, very wound up, very kind of stressed all the time. ; Patient: But recently it's just been a lot more draining than anything. ; Patient: Just quite lethargic, and I just can't be bothered anymore, and my body reflects that. ; Patient: But then when I try and sleep I just can't seem to have a satisfied night's sleep. ; Patient: It's really, really frustrating. ; Therapist: So it sounds like this is affecting you, it's draining you of your energy, like your body can't be bothered. ; Therapist: I think that's a really good way of describing it. ; Therapist: And you're noticing sleep problems as well. ; Therapist: And then, what do you do? ; Therapist: So this is, so we're back to the point before the lecture. ; Therapist: So you start having these thoughts, these emotions, and you know, your body, I guess it sounds like those thoughts are quite draining, so it'll be draining your energy. ; Therapist: What then happens, what do you do next? ; Patient: I kind of focus on the negative thoughts, and I probably should not think about them, ; Patient: but I focus on them and then I don't really want to do anything. ; Patient: I kind of stay in bed or... ; Therapist: So you think even more about those kind of worries that you have, so you do a bit of dwelling and you stay in bed. ; Therapist: And it sounds like you don't, you haven't tried speaking to your friends about it. ; Patient: No, I haven't. ; Therapist: Or speaking to family. ; Therapist: Okay, and then after you've done that, so after you've not gone to the lecture, you've stayed in bed, you've kind of spent time, as you said, focusing on those thoughts, those negative thoughts. ; Therapist: How do you feel after that? ; Therapist: Do you feel better or do you feel worse? ; Patient: I guess I feel slightly worse, but then a bit numb, in a way, kind of, I don't know. ; Patient: Once you've felt that, because I do feel tired all the time, I just try and push it out and then you don't really think about anything, and it's almost nicer that way than to keep focusing on how much you're getting wrong and how much you can't do stuff. ; Patient: Sometimes it's better just to not think about it at all. ; Therapist: So it sounds like in some ways it's a bit of a relief to do that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But in other ways maybe you think it might make things worse. ; Patient: Probably in the long run, yeah.",

; Patient: Sometimes I have problems with my attention and I was looking it up online and I'm really worried that I might have ADHD. ; Therapist: ADHD? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So we'll talk about that. ; Therapist: Let me ask you a few quick questions before we get to that. ; Therapist: Do you ever feel depressed? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Anxious? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Any trouble with drugs or alcohol or anything like that? ; Patient: Oh, no. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Why do you think you have ADHD? ; Patient: Oh, because I mean I've always had a problem with my attention and I can get distracted pretty easily. ; Therapist: So trouble establishing attention? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: How about difficulty in holding attention, like once you have established it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Trouble with both of those? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And you mentioned the word distracted? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you find yourself easily distracted?

; Patient: I'm 24. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And this problem with the attention affects you at work and at school? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And you said everywhere? ; Patient: Yeah, pretty much. ; Patient: It's part of my everyday life now. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You're 24 now. ; Therapist: When did you first notice the attention problems? ; Patient: Oh, I've always had that. ; Patient: I mean, even when I was in like elementary school, you know, I was always that kid. ; Therapist: You've had it for a long time? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about how disturbing it is? ; Therapist: Like, how much is it interfering with your functioning? ; Patient: It really, it really does. ; Therapist: It's really problematic? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I'm going to ask you a few other questions here. ; Therapist: We talked about the attention, so it's hard for you to give attention and hold attention. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Let's go with the school environment for now. ; Therapist: Let's talk about school. ; Therapist: How about listening in class? ; Patient: No, I don't really have a problem with that. ; Therapist: That's not a problem for you? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How about following instructions? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Tell me about your organizational skills. ; Patient: I'm very organized. ; Therapist: You're very organized? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I have to be in college. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself avoiding activities that require a lot of mental investment, mental energy? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you move toward those types of activities? ; Patient: Oh, I'm not opposed to them. ; Patient: Like, I like chess and checkers. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you ever find yourself losing things that you need to complete different jobs or tasks? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm going to change gears and ask you some other questions around a different area. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you ever find yourself fidgeting, tough to stay still? ; Patient: Not really, no. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: In school, again, we'll kind of stick with the school environment. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you find it difficult to stay seated? ; Patient: No, not at all. ; Therapist: How do you do when you are engaging in a quiet activity? ; Patient: I do pretty well. ; Therapist: You do okay with that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You don't find yourself wandering off with that? ; Patient: No, not at all. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you ever feel like internally there's a motor running and you can't shut it off? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: How about being talkative? ; Therapist: Do you find yourself talkative? ; Patient: I'm very talkative. ; Therapist: You're very talkative? ; Patient: Sometimes I end up being rude and I interrupt people. ; Patient: I just, I gotta get it out. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you feel like you talk a lot and that you interrupt? ; Patient: Yes, I do. ; Therapist: Interrupt people. ; Therapist: In a situation where it would be traditional to like wait in line or wait your turn, do you find that's difficult for you? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Do you ever find yourself, like for example in class, just saying something, like blurting something out without giving it much thought? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: I think I have what I need here and I want to get you in to see a counselor. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: If that works for you. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Because you did mention this was affecting your functioning. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So I want to make sure you get to see a counselor. ; Therapist: It will just take a couple days to get you in to see somebody if that works for you. ; Patient: That's great. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I appreciate you taking this time with me. ; Therapist: This information has been helpful. ; Patient: Thank you very much. ; Therapist: Thanks, Louise.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Elise, how you doing today? ; Patient: I'm good, but there has been an issue, you know how we've been working on like my motivation? ; Therapist: Sure. ; Patient: Well, it's kind of related to that. ; Patient: So I'm in school and every few weeks we have like papers to write. ; Patient: And I know I know it, I know I can do it. ; Patient: It's just actually sitting down and doing it. ; Therapist: All right, well tell me about the papers. ; Patient: Well, they're usually about five pages long. ; Patient: And I just look at it and I'm like, it's five pages. ; Patient: But I'm like, okay, so I go sit down, you know, at my computer, I'm like, all right, I'm going to start on references. ; Patient: So I get, you know, I start off good. ; Patient: I do the references, but then it's like, I get sidetracked so easily. ; Patient: And then I end up killing like two hours checking the news, checking, and then it goes to my phone and then just looking at recipes. ; Patient: I mean, it gets really off topic. ; Patient: And then I realized, you know, I haven't done anything. ; Therapist: All right, so you have a five page paper, you sit down to work on it. ; Therapist: You have the references, you get that part taken care of. ; Therapist: But then it sounds like you kind of wander off a little bit. ; Patient: Oh, big time. ; Therapist: Yeah, okay. ; Therapist: And then what happens after you are done wandering a little bit? ; Patient: Well, I get kind of annoyed with it. ; Patient: And then I'm like, well, you know, I've already, you know, it's already nighttime, I'll try to do it tomorrow. ; Patient: And then, you know, either tomorrow doesn't happen or the same thing happens. ; Patient: And then I end up rushing right at the end of, you know, the do tomorrow and getting all these five pages done. ; Patient: It's really hard for me. ; Therapist: So you are finishing the assignment on time. ; Therapist: So the problem isn't lateness. ; Patient: No, I mean, I get it done. ; Therapist: You get it done. ; Patient: It's just all at the last minute. ; Therapist: So it's really how the time breaks out isn't working out well for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You'd rather not be doing it at the last moment. ; Patient: No, I mean, I try not to. ; Patient: I mean, I set time aside to go sit down. ; Patient: I'm like, all right, you know, we're going to start on this paper, then sidetracked. ; Patient: I'm watching TV. ; Patient: I'm on my phone. ; Patient: I'm on some other website. ; Therapist: So these activities that you're engaging in between when you start the work and before you start writing, so we're gathering the references before you start writing. ; Therapist: You said check an email. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And other kind of, it sounds like unplanned small activities. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, there's small things that keep my attention, but that's not where my attention needs to go. ; Therapist: These aren't particularly engaging activities, like something you need to do at that moment? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No, I mean, I look up, you know, I start on one reference and then, ooh, this article looks cool. ; Patient: Ooh, this article. ; Patient: I'm researching octopuses or something. ; Therapist: So like distracted? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Distracted is a good word. ; Therapist: And then there's a moment when you kind of catch yourself and realize you haven't really started writing. ; Patient: Yeah, but it's like two hours late. ; Therapist: It's too late. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you're consuming time there. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you have a few different levels of activity here. ; Therapist: You have the paper, which it sounds like you're okay writing, but you're maybe not highly motivated to write. ; Therapist: But you seem to be getting the references done okay. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I get the references done okay. ; Therapist: You collect the material and then the writing part. ; Patient: That's the difficult part. ; Therapist: And then you have these behaviors in the middle, which you enjoy doing a little, but they're not something that... ; Patient: I mean, they're not something that I'm jumping for joy about. ; Patient: It's just something to procrastinate so I don't have to do my paper. ; Patient: I don't think that. ; Patient: I'm not like, oh, I need to check my email so I don't have to do my paper. ; Patient: It's just, oh, I should check my email. ; Patient: Oh, I should check my phone. ; Patient: Oh, I haven't done this in a while. ; Patient: Oh, I haven't seen this in a while. ; Therapist: But these behaviors still fulfill a purpose. ; Therapist: They do delay the writing of the paper. ; Patient: Yeah, that's true. ; Therapist: You may not be fully aware of that in the moment, but then you kind of become aware of that later, that that's the purpose that those behaviors accomplished. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And the other thing that I noticed was that they kept you distracted from the writing. ; Patient: That's true. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So the writing of the paper is an activity. ; Therapist: That's a behavior that's something you're not really looking forward to. ; Therapist: What's a behavior that... ; Therapist: What's an activity that you really do look forward to, that you kind of think about and some level of engagement is there? ; Patient: Well, there is this new TV show out that they just started a new season and I have it all recorded, like 24 episodes, but I can't find time to watch it. ; Patient: But I'm really, you know, I've seen the first season, I'm so interested in it. ; Patient: I can't wait to see the next one. ; Patient: I guess that's what makes me really happy right now. ; Therapist: So you're excited about this television show and you have the episodes already recorded. ; Therapist: And maybe one of the reasons you can't find the time is because the time you're using between the two parts of writing this paper. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, this paper's taken me a lot longer than it should. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So let's try this. ; Therapist: When you do write the paper, you're really writing it, the writing part, not the preparing part, but the writing part kind of all at the end, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're getting it done, but it's the night before it's due. ; Patient: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: So I want to try a couple of different behavioral strategies here. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And these might be similar to what we tried before working with motivation. ; Therapist: One is I think that it might be helpful, and I want you to let me know if I'm right here, to break, if it's a five-page paper, to break it up into more than one night. ; Therapist: Because right now, functionally, at least a lot of it you're doing on the last night. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Therapist: What would be a more comfortable pace? ; Therapist: For example, how long does it take you to write one page? ; Patient: About an hour, hour and a half. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So around an hour to an hour and a half, you can complete one page, edit it, proofread? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it would take about five days for you to complete the whole paper. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: If you did an hour and a half each day, an hour to an hour and a half each day. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What do you have from when the paper's assigned to when it's due? ; Patient: They give us about a week and a half to do it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So around 10 days? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So if you could maintain the pace of an hour to an hour and a half a day, you would be done in plenty of time. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Is there a good time to write, like to start writing? ; Patient: I guess around six o'clock, because then I'm already done eating, I'm home from work, and I've kind of de-stressed already. ; Patient: Six o'clock's a pretty good time. ; Therapist: So if you could work without distraction, you would be done by around 7.30 at the latest? ; Therapist: With just one page? ; Patient: Yeah, with one page. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So no distractions and just one page? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So talk about the episodes, the TV episodes that you want to watch. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: How long are they? ; Patient: They're an hour. ; Therapist: They're an hour? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what's a time that you could watch those or you get the maximum enjoyment out of watching them? ; Therapist: Like no distractions? ; Patient: I guess around eight o'clock, because that's when I'm starting to get ready for bed and starting to really relax. ; Patient: And my husband's home by that time, and we can watch it together. ; Patient: He loves the show too. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So eight o'clock's a really good time for you to maximize what you'll get out of the show, the enjoyment you'll get out of the show. ; Therapist: So what I want to do is try to pair these behaviors together, the behavior of writing, which is not something that you're necessarily thrilled about all the time, but you are getting it done just not in the time schedule you like. ; Therapist: And the behavior of watching the show is you are more or less excited about it. ; Patient: I mean, I'm very interested in that. ; Therapist: That's a great motivator for you. ; Therapist: And I want to try to use it as a motivator, kind of like a reward. ; Therapist: So what I'd like you to try to do is when you get one of these papers assigned, the five page papers, pick the five nights that you want to work on it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: It could be Monday through Friday or whatever works for you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right? ; Therapist: Clearly within the 10 day window though. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: So five days within the 10 day window do you have to turn in. ; Therapist: And then set that time at six o'clock is when you're going to start because that's a good time for you to work. ; Therapist: And when you try to work straight through to seven or seven thirty, I know that's a challenge, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: When that period of distraction might encroach, right? ; Therapist: We know that might happen. ; Therapist: Focus on, I really want to watch that show at eight o'clock. ; Patient: So just keep thinking about that when I feel like I'm getting off track? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's your, in a way, that's your reward. ; Therapist: That's your motivation. ; Therapist: That's kind of what you're looking forward to, to get through something that you don't necessarily enjoy a lot. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You're going to be using what you do enjoy a lot to help push you through that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Therapist: In the process, I hope that the writing becomes more enjoyable. ; Therapist: You know, we'll see. ; Therapist: But whether it does or it doesn't, you still want to be able to complete it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And not have to stress right at the end. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And not waste that time in the middle. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: That's really eating more time than your show takes. ; Patient: Really, it is. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: I mean, you're right. ; Patient: I could watch that show with the amount of time I waste just doing other things. ; Therapist: So the key here is to try to keep it structured. ; Therapist: Like if that plan that I've laid out works for you, does that make sense for you? ; Patient: It does. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Because we can modify it if it doesn't. ; Therapist: Try that now and we can always change it up. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: If we need to. ; Therapist: But I think that does make sense and it gives you time to finish the paper. ; Therapist: And I think it divides it into manageable periods of time. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But the key is here to start on time, six o'clock, and to intend to and try to start the show on time at eight o'clock. ; Therapist: Try to keep that structure. ; Therapist: So you have the behavior that's not necessarily too excited about but you kind of have to do at some point. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that show that you're really looking forward to. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You're going to pair those together. ; Patient: No, I see where you're getting at. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Does this make sense to you? ; Therapist: Do you understand kind of? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: You know, that'd help me power through and not do things unrelated. ; Patient: You might think, well, if I get this paper done, this page done, I get to watch my show later. ; Therapist: And I think that's a helpful way to think about it. ; Therapist: And that's the cognitive part of this. ; Therapist: So this is a behavioral strategy because we talked about these in the past, right? ; Therapist: This is a behavioral strategy. ; Therapist: The cognitive piece is when you find yourself wandering, right, that you have to detect that. ; Therapist: And I think you have some level of awareness that's happening. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You have to detect that and say, oh, I want to watch my show. ; Therapist: I'm really looking forward to it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: And that's your motivation to move it through the paper and then you know when eight o'clock comes. ; Patient: I get to watch my show. ; Therapist: You get to watch your show! ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: That sounds like a plan. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Very good. ; Therapist: So let's try that for, I'll see you again in roughly two weeks. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you have a paper assigned between now and then? ; Patient: I actually do. ; Therapist: You do? ; Therapist: So let's try it with this next paper. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: The one that will be assigned before I see you again. ; Therapist: And let's try the five day and we'll evaluate how it goes and make any changes if we need to. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: Sound good? ; Patient: Yep. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: Thank you! ; Therapist: I'll see you in a few weeks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Counselors and other school personnel often have the opportunity to discuss risk behaviors with students, like drinking alcohol. ; Therapist: They have a unique role as both representatives of the school and professionals whose job it is to advocate for the students. ; Therapist: The counselor's approach and tone throughout such conversations are likely to influence the degree with which students trust them. ; Therapist: Watch what happens when this counselor uses a judgmental stance and lectures the student about school policies and the dangers of drinking. ; Therapist: Hi Laura, so thanks for coming in. ; Therapist: I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about. ; Therapist: So basically I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school, usually once or twice per semester. ; Therapist: And we're going to talk about whatever's kind of going on in your life. ; Therapist: I'll ask you some questions about your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things. ; Therapist: And then we'll talk a little bit about different behaviors and stuff like that. ; Therapist: And so it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself? ; Patient: Okay, my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what do you like to do for fun? ; Patient: Mostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends, things like that. ; Therapist: And when you and your friends are hanging out, what do you do? ; Therapist: Go to football games, go to parties? ; Patient: Yeah, if it's school related, maybe like a game or two or go to the mall to shop or go to the movies or something. ; Patient: And at night maybe like a party or something if someone's throwing. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what kinds of hobbies do you have? ; Patient: I like to read and I like to go outside and take walks and hike and stuff. ; Patient: I'm very outdoorsy. ; Therapist: Oh, cool. ; Therapist: What are your plans for after high school? ; Patient: Well, I plan to apply to college and maybe, you know, have a good career and something like that, hopefully. ; Therapist: That's great. ; Therapist: What do you think you'll study? ; Patient: Well, I'm looking into journalism, maybe pre-law. ; Therapist: Oh, neat. ; Patient: Which is a little different, but. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's great. ; Therapist: That's a really good goal. ; Patient: Yeah, thanks. ; Therapist: That's hard work to get into law school. ; Therapist: Are you doing well in school? ; Therapist: What kind of grades do you get? ; Patient: Yeah, I'm doing okay. ; Patient: I'm getting mostly A's and B's, so I'm pretty good. ; Patient: I'm okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What grades are you not getting A's and B's in? ; Patient: I think all my grades are A's and B's. ; Therapist: Oh, okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And do you know where you're going to apply to college? ; Therapist: I'm not sure yet, but I'm looking into schools like in the area, so maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll leave home or something. ; Therapist: Okay, cool. ; Therapist: And, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or journalism? ; Patient: Well, I'm definitely not a math or science person, so I started off by there and then I started looking at careers that maybe I would like, so. ; Therapist: Okay, great. ; Therapist: Sounds like you have, like I said, really good goals and you're working hard in school. ; Therapist: You said that when you're going out with your friends, you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol? ; Patient: Not really, maybe one or two drinks at a party, that's the most. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And how often do you think you drink? ; Patient: Maybe like once or twice a month at the most. ; Therapist: So like once or twice a month you're having alcohol? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And so that's maybe like 20 times a year? ; Patient: Possibly, yeah. ; Therapist: So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then. ; Patient: Yeah, I guess you can say that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What do you think is the most you've ever had? ; Patient: Just two drinks at a party at the most. ; Patient: I don't like to drink a lot. ; Patient: Getting drunk is not something that appeals to me, so I just have like a drink in my hand so my friends won't bug me about not drinking, just like to look like I'm actually doing something. ; Patient: Most of the time I don't even drink at all. ; Therapist: But you've been drunk before? ; Patient: No, not really, maybe tipsy but not like drunk. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, interesting. ; Therapist: So do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So one of the things that, you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. ; Therapist: So you know, that's actually a really big problem and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident. ; Therapist: So that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing. ; Therapist: Have you ever done that? ; Therapist: Have you ever gotten in a car? ; Patient: No, I've never drunk driven and I've never gotten in a car with a drunk driver. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How much do your friends drink? ; Patient: I mean, I have some friends that drink some more than others. ; Patient: My close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that but I know that there are people that drink a lot more. ; Therapist: What about at these parties you're going to? ; Therapist: Are there other kids there who are drinking a lot? ; Patient: Yeah, there are kids that drink a lot more than I do, definitely. ; Therapist: And do you hang out with them? ; Patient: Not really closely. ; Patient: Like I know who they are and I'll say hi but they're not really like close friends of mine. ; Therapist: So, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. ; Therapist: Did you know that? ; Patient: Yeah, that makes sense. ; Therapist: Yeah, so there's, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like not just car accidents but you can have other accidents. ; Therapist: You know, people, you know, will fall or, you know, break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down. ; Therapist: As a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted. ; Therapist: You know, especially if you've been drinking then you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you. ; Therapist: Have you thought about that? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, I have. ; Patient: That's one of the main reasons I don't like to drink that much. ; Therapist: And then, you know, people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too. ; Therapist: Also, you know, there have been a lot of kids even at this school who have gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and, you know, we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy. ; Therapist: Have you thought about that? ; Patient: Yeah, definitely, yeah. ; Therapist: But you're still drinking. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, I guess it's the thing to do at a party, so. ; Therapist: So, I mean, do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney? ; Patient: Definitely not. ; Patient: That's why I don't try to drink that much. ; Patient: Just make it look like I am kind of. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer. ; Therapist: Obviously, you shouldn't be drinking at all. ; Therapist: What do you think about that? ; Patient: I definitely agree. ; Patient: I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol other than the ones you mentioned like health wise and things like that. ; Patient: So I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing. ; Therapist: So do you think you can quit? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, it's not like a really big part of my life, so. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And that's going to be your goal. ; Therapist: And that's great. ; Therapist: That's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision. ; Therapist: So, I guess, can you quit this weekend then? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Patient: I'll just not have a drink. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And then what about your friends who are still drinking? ; Patient: I really can't control what they do, but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what if they won't? ; Patient: Well, then I guess I'll just try to hang around them less or something or try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party or anything. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Probably if your friends won't quit drinking, you should just find new friends. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Because, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're going to pressure you into drinking, and then you're going to feel awkward, and, you know, you're going to be stuck and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking. ; Therapist: They're probably not a good influence. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And then you'll be better set for college too because, you know, the issue is you're getting good grades now, but when you get to college, it's a lot harder. ; Therapist: And, you know, if you're needing really good grades to get into law school, which you will be, then you really can't be distracted by alcohol. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you. ; Therapist: Let's see. ; Therapist: I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking. ; Patient: They would be pretty upset. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: They don't really condone alcohol use. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, like I said, I'm going to write down here that you've decided to quit and, you know, I'm going to be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that, you know, that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking. ; Therapist: Is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I think I'm good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Any questions or anything like that? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I have no questions. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You're sure? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, that's probably it then. ; Therapist: You can head back to class and thanks for coming in. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: So, I want to change gears a little and talk about your family. ; Therapist: Is that okay? ; Patient: Oh, that's a lot, but it's all right. ; Therapist: A lot of information there, huh? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, can we start with your parents and tell me, will you feel comfortable telling me about ; Therapist: them? ; Patient: Well, my father was incarcerated when I was four for drug trafficking. ; Therapist: Drug trafficking? ; Patient: Yep. ; Patient: And he died a few years ago from a stroke. ; Therapist: How many years ago? ; Patient: About three years ago. ; Therapist: Three years. ; Therapist: At what age was he when he passed away? ; Patient: To be honest, I don't even remember. ; Patient: I don't really talk to him. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about your mother? ; Patient: My mom is crazy. ; Patient: She's always been very, like, eccentric, I guess would be the word. ; Therapist: Eccentric? ; Patient: We don't talk anymore because she has chosen gambling over the family. ; Therapist: Tell me about that. ; Patient: When I was in high school and I would, you know, still live with her, sometimes I would come home and there was no running water, there was no electricity, there was no nothing. ; Patient: She had gambled the money away. ; Patient: We've had several times where I've had to hide the cars in fear of them being repossessed. ; Patient: And I couldn't take it after a while and I moved out when I was about 16. ; Patient: She calls me every now and then, sometimes for money, sometimes to talk. ; Patient: I don't really talk to her though. ; Therapist: So how would you describe the quality of your relationship right now with her? ; Patient: Not good. ; Therapist: Not good? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And it sounds like there's not much communication. ; Patient: Not anymore, no. ; Patient: She's dry, but I refuse to speak to her. ; Therapist: Do you know if your father or mother, either one, has any history of mental illness? ; Patient: My mom was diagnosed as bipolar. ; Patient: My father, like I said, I don't know much about him. ; Patient: I know he had a problem with anger too. ; Therapist: You remember that? ; Patient: Yeah, I do. ; Patient: But he would physically abuse us. ; Therapist: He physically abused you? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: From what I remember of him. ; Therapist: Alright, so that's your father and your mother. ; Therapist: How about any siblings? ; Patient: I have an older sister and a younger sister. ; Therapist: Two sisters? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Tell me about them. ; Patient: Well, my older sister pretty much raised me and my younger sister since mom was never around and dad was in jail. ; Patient: I love her to death. ; Patient: She's the godmother of my kids. ; Patient: She's my best friend. ; Therapist: This is your older sister? ; Patient: Yeah, my older sister. ; Therapist: How about your younger sister? ; Patient: My younger sister, we don't talk very much. ; Patient: She doesn't want to talk to me. ; Patient: She says I'm a bad influence. ; Therapist: A bad influence on her? ; Patient: Her, her friends. ; Patient: I think she's kind of stuck up. ; Therapist: What makes you think that? ; Patient: Because she thinks she's better than me. ; Patient: Just because, ooh, she went to college. ; Patient: Well, good for you. ; Therapist: All right, so it sounds like you have a positive relationship, kind of admire your older sister. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Is that right? ; Patient: Yeah, I love my older sister. ; Therapist: And the relationship with your younger sister is a little bit different. ; Patient: I mean, I love her too and I can deal with her in small things, but that's pretty much ; Patient: it. ; Therapist: How often do you communicate with each one? ; Patient: My older sister I talk to like almost every day. ; Patient: You know, she's always there, you know, shoulder to cry on or, you know, if I'm in a bind and I need some money, she's always willing to help me out. ; Patient: She can watch the kids if I need to go somewhere. ; Patient: She's my rock. ; Patient: The younger one, I mean, we talk maybe every other week. ; Patient: Let us know what each other's up to. ; Patient: Maybe we'll go to dinner. ; Therapist: All right, so quite a bit closer to your older sister than your younger sister. ; Therapist: Any mental health history with either sister? ; Patient: My older sister was depressed and had a lot of anxiety when she was young because she dealt with more of my dad than I did. ; Patient: The younger one, I really don't know. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So does your older sister or your younger sister for that matter know that you're here? ; Patient: My older sister does. ; Patient: My older sister, I haven't spoken to her this week yet, so. ; Therapist: Are you planning on telling her? ; Patient: No, I don't see why not. ; Patient: No, maybe it'll kind of humanize her a little bit and like I'm not as bad as the person she thinks I am. ; Therapist: Do you feel a need to make a positive impression on her? ; Patient: No, but I think sometimes it's easier. ; Therapist: It's easier? ; Patient: Yeah, it's easier. ; Patient: Not being the bad sister. ; Therapist: That's how you believe you're viewed? ; Patient: Yeah, by her. ; Therapist: By her, okay. ; Therapist: All right, how about grandparents? ; Patient: My dad's side of the family we don't really know about. ; Patient: Grandma died before I was born. ; Patient: Grandpa wasn't in the picture. ; Patient: On my mom's side, grandpa died before I was born and grandma lived in a nursing home and was kind of like out of it by then. ; Therapist: Any mental health history with any grandparents that you're aware of? ; Patient: I mean, the one grandma that was still alive, she had like some kind of dementia or something. ; Patient: Alzheimer's, dementia. ; Therapist: How about aunts, uncles, cousins, anybody have a note? ; Patient: I had a lot of cousins. ; Patient: A lot of cousins in and out of the house at various points in the, even in the day sometimes I leave for school there'd be a certain set of cousins there come home from school, completely different set. ; Patient: We were like the family central. ; Therapist: Do you have contact with any of them? ; Patient: They're like social media and stuff. ; Patient: I mean, they're all spread out over the country now, but I keep in contact with them as much as I can. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about children? ; Patient: I have two children. ; Therapist: Okay, tell me about them. ; Patient: They are the loves of my life. ; Patient: And one is in second grade, the other is in kindergarten right now. ; Patient: The one in kindergarten though, he's kind of a handful. ; Patient: He recently is at a stage where he gets mad if I try to change his diapers, but will let my sister do it. ; Patient: I don't know why that's going on, but. ; Therapist: Which sister? ; Patient: My older sister. ; Patient: She watches them when I'm off. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So one in kindergarten. ; Patient: One in kindergarten, the other in second grade. ; Therapist: In second grade. ; Therapist: And you mentioned the one in kindergarten is a son. ; Therapist: And how about the one in second grade? ; Patient: My daughter. ; Therapist: Tell me about her. ; Patient: She comes home with like, they have like, not demerits, but like little referrals. ; Patient: She likes to be kind of a pushover. ; Patient: Not pushover, but like a bully at school. ; Therapist: A bully? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I've gotten several calls from the principal and our teachers saying, oh, she pushed another kid. ; Patient: Oh, another kid asked if he could have a piece of paper and she yelled and screamed. ; Patient: And you know, she comes home and I'll yell at her too. ; Patient: Do you like this? ; Patient: Do you like me yelling at you? ; Patient: Why would you yell at somebody else? ; Patient: She just doesn't get it. ; Therapist: What kind of problem were you? ; Therapist: Her behavior? ; Patient: Well, yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I got in trouble at school too. ; Patient: Not when I was her age. ; Patient: I was kind of better at school when I was at her age, but I don't want her to go down the same path. ; Therapist: But you're a little worried about that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How often do you see them? ; Patient: I see them, I mean, I work, so I don't see them when I'm there. ; Patient: They go to daycare, but sometimes if I like go out to a party or something where I know some stuff is going to be there or there's parties over at my house where I know some stuff is going to be there, I drop them off with my sister. ; Patient: You know, try to keep them away from that. ; Patient: I don't want them to be exposed to that. ; Therapist: When you say stuff, just so I'm clear, you mean drugs? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Drugs, alcohol, you know. ; Patient: I'd rather my kids not see me like that, so I save them from it. ; Therapist: So you're protecting them from that. ; Patient: Oh yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah.",

; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How'd that go? ; Patient: I mean I've seen that stuff before, but it wasn't too bad. ; Therapist: Nothing surprising in there? ; Patient: No, pretty standard. ; Therapist: Pretty standard. ; Therapist: Nothing distressing? ; Patient: Not yet. ; Therapist: Not yet? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm going to ask you a series of questions as part of a process called intake. ; Therapist: So this document that I'll be making notes on will go in your chart and it'll help guide your care for the time that you're with me. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright? ; Therapist: So these questions are going to be more detailed and more emotionally oriented than a lot of those questions that you were answering on the forms you filled out before. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: That was more like factual information that we need for insurance or record keeping. ; Therapist: This is more about you and what you've been going through. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You comfortable with that? ; Patient: Yeah, it's okay. ; Therapist: It's okay? ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: If at any time you don't like one of the questions or you don't want to answer one of the questions, just let me know and we'll just skip over that. ; Patient: Okay, fair enough. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So what brings you in today? ; Patient: I brought myself in. ; Patient: Things have just not been fantastic so I figured I might as well get some help. ; Patient: Before it got worse. ; Therapist: Things haven't been fantastic? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you're worried they're going to get worse? ; Patient: Seems like it, yeah. ; Therapist: What would you say that your main problem is that motivates you to come in? ; Patient: Probably my anxiety. ; Patient: I'm just nervous about a lot of things a lot of the time and it's kind of trickling into every area of my life now. ; Therapist: So anxiety? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You said it's like a nervousness? ; Patient: Yeah, just like nervousness about going places, nervousness about doing things or school or work or you know graduating college. ; Patient: Just kind of that whole stage and it's been like that for a while. ; Therapist: How long? ; Patient: I can remember as far back as like 13 or 14 maybe. ; Therapist: How old are you now? ; Patient: 23 ; Therapist: So this is around 10 years you've been coping with this? ; Patient: Yeah, off and on, yeah. ; Therapist: Off and on? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So there's times when you're not anxious? ; Patient: Not as bad. ; Patient: I mean I'm still anxious but not as extreme or I don't deal with it in the same way. ; Therapist: If you were to rate your anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being really no anxiety and 10 being the worst it's been in the last 10 years, how much anxiety do you have right ; Therapist: now? ; Patient: I think a 6. ; Therapist: When was the last time you were a 10? ; Patient: Last weekend? ; Therapist: When was the last time you were a 1? ; Patient: I'm not really sure. ; Therapist: Approximately? ; Patient: Maybe like a couple months ago when I was just hanging out with my friends. ; Patient: We went out and we were partying a little bit and it was nice. ; Patient: I wasn't too anxious. ; Therapist: About a couple months ago? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So the anxiety is one problem. ; Therapist: Any other problems? ; Patient: I don't think it's a huge problem but I have been drinking a lot. ; Patient: But it helps with the anxiety but it makes going out and you know I'm more relaxed that way. ; Patient: But I can be kind of a compulsive person so once I start I keep going. ; Patient: So it's not all the time. ; Patient: It's just happening when I'm going out but I end up drinking too much. ; Therapist: So sometimes when you go out you drink more than you want to? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What happens then? ; Patient: I make bad decisions or I get sick or the next morning I'm showing up hungover going to class. ; Patient: If I make class and you know it's fun for the time being but it's not fun afterwards. ; Therapist: So the consequences of drinking in the longer run. ; Therapist: You're not too fond of those but in the short run. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It helps in the moment. ; Therapist: So you want the anxiety to be lessened. ; Therapist: Do you want the drinking to be lessened? ; Patient: Probably. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean I'd like to still have fun in college but I would like to not be like blacking out or being able to stop would be nice. ; Therapist: Is that what happens now? ; Therapist: You black out? ; Patient: Occasionally. ; Patient: Not every time but sometimes. ; Therapist: Sometimes? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you remember the last time you blacked out? ; Patient: Maybe a month ago. ; Therapist: Month ago? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's not all the time though. ; Therapist: What age did you start drinking? ; Patient: 14 ; Therapist: 14? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Any other problems? ; Therapist: You have anxiety ; Therapist: You have drinking alcohol ; Therapist: Any other problems? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Therapist: So those are the two main things that are bothering you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So I want to ask you some questions about your history. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: And I'm going to try to divide this up into different areas and just kind of move from one area to the next. ; Therapist: There will be some overlap. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So if I ask you the same question more than once it's just kind of part of that overlap that occurs. ; Therapist: First I'd like to cover your family history. ; Therapist: So can you tell me about your immediate family? ; Patient: I have one sister. ; Patient: Mom and dad. ; Patient: Pretty typical. ; Patient: My sister is really successful. ; Patient: She's a doctor. ; Patient: Though are my parents really successful too. ; Patient: So basic family. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: What type of relationship do you have with your sister? ; Patient: Kind of like a Merry Christmas, Happy Easter type of relationship. ; Patient: We're more like acquaintances than we are siblings. ; Therapist: Would you describe it as distant? ; Patient: Yeah, I'd say so. ; Patient: I mean we're nice. ; Patient: We're not like, but we're not going to be like involved in each other's lives really. ; Therapist: Do you know what caused the relationship to end up that way? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: She was always kind of the ideal child. ; Patient: She went and did everything that she was supposed to do and it was easy for her. ; Patient: So constantly being compared to that doesn't really foster a great relationship. ; Therapist: Who compared you to your sister? ; Patient: My dad usually. ; Patient: Sometimes my mom. ; Patient: Depends on the day. ; Therapist: Was this a frequent occurrence, the comparison? ; Patient: Yeah, for sure. ; Therapist: Do you feel like it had an impact on you? ; Patient: Probably. ; Patient: It wasn't like I wasn't trying, but not everything can be as easy as it is for some people. ; Patient: So a little acknowledgement might be nice. ; Therapist: Alright, so let's move out a little further. ; Therapist: So you talked about your mother, your father, your sister. ; Therapist: Any other siblings? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How about grandparents? ; Patient: They're around. ; Patient: Typical grandparents, not super involved, but they're there sometimes. ; Therapist: Good relationship? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, you know, grandparents show up and it's always like, hi, how's it going? ; Patient: And you see them at the next holiday type of thing. ; Therapist: Alright, so there's not one grandparent you're particularly close to? ; Patient: I do have one grandfather I talk to on a more personal level than I would my other ones. ; Patient: But that's gotten more distant in the past couple of years. ; Therapist: How about aunts, uncles, cousins? ; Patient: I have a couple of cousins that I would hang out with or I'll see out when I'm hanging out with my friends or whatever. ; Patient: So we'll hang out if we run into each other. ; Patient: Aunts and uncles I do have. ; Patient: They're not super involved either, but everybody's cordial. ; Therapist: Everybody's cordial? ; Patient: Yeah, nice when they see you type of thing. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So when's the last time you spoke, say for example, with one of your cousins? ; Patient: I think I ran into one of them only two weeks ago, or just out. ; Therapist: A couple weeks ago? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do any of the relatives that you mentioned, are any of them aware of your anxiety and or your drinking? ; Patient: My parents are. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Nobody else? ; Patient: My sister knows about the anxiety part of it. ; Patient: And I think, I'm pretty sure she knows about the drinking, but she doesn't bring it up. ; Patient: But if my parents know, I'm sure she knows. ; Therapist: Hmm. ; Therapist: So you believe that they told her? ; Patient: I'm sure. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But she's not mentioned that to you directly? ; Patient: No, we don't have those types of conversations. ; Patient: It's more like, oh, she messed up again, and it's just sort of like this funny thing and then they move on. ; Therapist: Hmm. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So you see this bothers you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's annoying. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Some of these topics that we're going to touch on in this intake, we can talk about in greater detail later on. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright, so, and maybe your relationship with your mother and father and your sister would be topics we could touch on later on, maybe not, but I want to let you know that we can come back to anything and review it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So I want to move kind of out of family history a bit and through to social relationships. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Again, it's kind of similar, a little bit of overlap here. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about any romantic interests, friends, anything like that? ; Patient: Yeah, I have a guy I've been seeing for like six months, so it's pretty serious for college. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And some of my college friends I'm really close with, so they're there with me for a lot. ; Therapist: About how many? ; Patient: There's three girls that I'm super close with. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: And, you know, college, there's a lot of people I'm acquaintances with or I'll see or talk to in class or whatever, but those three girls are kind of the ones I would go to if I needed something. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: And then you have some other friends that you're not as close to? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, we're nice and we have fun and, you know, I'm sure if something happened they would bail me out, but they're not like people I'm going to talk to about my problems or anything like that. ; Therapist: Do they know about your problems? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I guess you could know, like, when I show up to class if I'm over, but I'm sure I'm not the only one doing that, so. ; Therapist: And how about the guy you've seen for six months, does he know about your problems? ; Patient: Somewhat, yeah. ; Patient: He knows about, definitely knows about the anxiety and he's with me a lot when I go out, so if something does happen he's usually helping me out or making sure I get home or whatever. ; Therapist: So he's supportive? ; Patient: Yeah, really supportive. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So some of the questions I'm going to ask you, this gives me a good opportunity to talk about this, I probably could guess the answer to, but I still want to ask, not be presumptuous. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you have any children? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay, how about nieces or nephews? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Any other social relationships that I've missed here that are important to you? ; Patient: I don't think so, those are the main ones right now. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Therapist: Alright, she said you were 23. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Have you had any surgeries in your lifetime? ; Patient: I got my appendix removed. ; Therapist: Appendix removed? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any other serious medical conditions? ; Patient: No, I've had my wisdom teeth taken out. ; Therapist: Wisdom teeth extracted? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Are you on any medications for physical problems? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: How about your activity level? ; Therapist: Do you stay fairly active? ; Patient: Yeah, I try to. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: I go to the gym like twice a week or whatever, and I go to yoga sometimes, so yeah, I try to get out. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So you consider yourself an active person? ; Patient: Yeah, I try to be in between classes and everything else, but when I do have the time, I enjoy going out and doing things. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Would you generally say you're in good health then? ; Patient: Yeah, physically, yeah. ; Therapist: Physically? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: No other illnesses, surgeries, procedures, with no? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So I want to shift gears a little bit again and now talk about psychiatric history. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: And what I'm getting at here is kind of a history of any diagnoses, medications, other times have been treated by a counselor or somebody like a counselor. ; Therapist: Let's start with medications. ; Therapist: Are you on any medications? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Mental health? ; Patient: No? ; Therapist: How about history of diagnoses? ; Therapist: Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition? ; Patient: Yeah, I was. ; Patient: I was seeing a therapist before a couple years ago. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: And I saw him a couple of times and I think he said I had some sort of anxiety disorder or something. ; Therapist: Do you remember specifically what he said? ; Patient: Something more general. ; Patient: So, like it wasn't about any particular thing. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: So I saw him for a little while but I just really wasn't on board with local therapy at that point and I didn't think it was going to help. ; Therapist: How old were you, yourself? ; Patient: 15 or 16. ; Patient: 15 ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright, so and that was a counselor? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright, so you saw the counselor. ; Therapist: The counselor indicated you had some type of anxiety disorder. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you feel that was a fair assessment? ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how long did you see the counselor? ; Patient: I think about five or six times maybe. ; Therapist: Five or six sessions? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And why did you discontinue the treatment? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I just didn't really feel like I was really involved in it and it felt like it was more a waste of my time and his. ; Patient: I wasn't ready. ; Patient: I don't know that I was super on board with the whole anxiety thing at that point. ; Patient: I mean he was nice. ; Patient: There wasn't like an issue with him. ; Patient: I just don't, I wasn't there. ; Therapist: And you mentioned at that time about the drinking? ; Patient: I think I brought it up but I didn't really see it as an issue then. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: How about other mental health professionals like a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a marriage and family therapist? ; Patient: My parents told me to see a psychiatrist like maybe once or twice but didn't really stick with that either. ; Therapist: You weren't prescribed any medication? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And what do you think happened there that you didn't stick with that? ; Patient: I think kind of the same thing. ; Patient: I knew that obviously there was something going on but I don't think I was ready to deal with it. ; Patient: And I kind of felt like I had it under control at that point. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about when you saw the psychiatrist in relation to when you saw the counselor? ; Patient: It was all within that same time period. ; Patient: I think I saw the counselor first and then maybe the psychiatrist like a week or two later and then followed up with the counselor but I just wasn't really present during any of it. ; Therapist: Do you feel you're in a different state of mind now? ; Patient: Yeah, I think so. ; Therapist: Tell me about that. ; Patient: I realize now that I'm not handling it like I thought I was and it's affecting other areas of my life. ; Patient: And you know in my senior year of college I need to get my life together and I'm not really doing that too often, so I think it's time to figure something out. ; Therapist: Alright, so you feel like you're ready to commit the treatment a little more vigorously at this point? ; Patient: Yeah, I want the help now. ; Therapist: And back then? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? Okay. ; Therapist: And no other treatment providers? ; Patient: No, just those. ; Therapist: Okay, just those two.",

; Patient: Well, I'm sick, I think. ; Patient: So we've been running some tests and things, and she couldn't find anything. ; Patient: So she's already working on it. ; Patient: I'm not sure what she's doing. ; Patient: We've been running some tests and things, and she couldn't find anything. ; Patient: So she thought maybe I should come talk to you. ; Patient: I guess maybe my concerns are, you know, coming from somewhere else, I think, is what she thinks. ; Patient: But I don't know. ; Patient: Maybe whatever illness I have is making me feel this way. ; Therapist: So you believe you have a physical illness? ; Patient: Yeah, I just know there's something not right. ; Therapist: And your physician has run a series of tests? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: We've done like blood work and all the scans and everything. ; Patient: She said she didn't find anything, but I just know there's something there. ; Therapist: So what was her, other than coming to see me, what was her suggestion for treatment? ; Therapist: So she ran tests, she didn't find anything? ; Patient: Well, yeah, she didn't have anything for me. ; Therapist: So she's saying there's no physical illness? ; Patient: Yeah, that's what she says. ; Therapist: You're not as sure? ; Patient: No, I think she's missing something. ; Patient: So... ; Therapist: How long have you believed that you had a physical illness? ; Patient: About a year, I think, is when my first appointment with my physician was. ; Patient: Yeah, when she started running some tests and things. ; Therapist: So about a year ago, you went to her. ; Therapist: She started running tests and there was no findings of a disorder? ; Patient: No, she hasn't found anything yet. ; Therapist: Was it just one disorder that you thought you had or have there been several? ; Patient: You know, I kind of started with MS. ; Patient: I read some things about that and about how people just, people my age, they've had it and they don't even know that they have it and then all of a sudden their life is changed by it. ; Patient: So I was concerned about that. ; Patient: And then I guess after some tests and things, I kind of, I don't know, I guess I started to think maybe it wasn't that and it was something else. ; Patient: I think it's cancer. ; Patient: That's what I'm worried about. ; Patient: You think it's cancer? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: You know, even though I don't really have some of the symptoms, I can just lie in you and you have no idea and just one day, you know. ; Therapist: And your physicians run tests for all these disorders you thought you had or you think you had? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: But I mean, what if that test that I took a year ago, what if it didn't show up on that because it hasn't gotten that severe yet and now it is? ; Therapist: So you're worried? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you saw the physician for the first time regarding this a year ago. ; Therapist: Did you have anxiety or worry before that? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I'm just worried that it started, got that feeling that I was sick. ; Patient: So that was just what I was worried about. ; Patient: But nothing other than that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: But you were worried about the illness? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Nothing else though? ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Do you have any physical symptoms? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: But that happens to people. ; Patient: They don't experience any symptoms. ; Patient: They have no idea. ; Patient: No idea. ; Patient: And then it just, you're dead. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself checking often to see if you have physical symptoms? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: I've read a lot of stuff, a lot of different people's stories. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Go to the internet, check the symptoms, and I keep track of that, make sure I'm not having anything that they list. ; Therapist: Are you active on the internet forums where they discuss illnesses? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: I've read a lot of people's stories on there about how they had maybe one symptom, but they didn't really think anything of it, you know, and then they have a severe diagnosis. ; Patient: So I'm just worried I'm going to miss something, you know, so I check a lot and check to make sure. ; Therapist: So you read the forms a lot. ; Therapist: Do you ever post? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, about my concerns. ; Patient: Sometimes people get a little frustrated with me. ; Patient: They're not very nice. ; Therapist: Tell me about that. ; Patient: Just because I'm not really experiencing anything. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: They think that I don't have anything to worry about, and they keep telling me, but I think I do have something to worry about. ; Patient: I just have this feeling that there's something wrong. ; Patient: I just know it. ; Therapist: What would you like us to do here at the agency? ; Patient: I would just like to feel comfortable that I'm not sick. ; Patient: I don't want to worry anymore, but I just really think there's something wrong. ; Therapist: Yeah, you're worried you have a physical health disorder. ; Therapist: Are you worried you have a mental health disorder? ; Therapist: Maybe. ; Patient: Some people have said that. ; Patient: Are you worried about that? ; Patient: It's a little concern that I might be feeling a little extra worried. ; Patient: Maybe that's a symptom of the whatever illness I have. ; Therapist: So you're concerned that the worry could be a symptom of a physical illness? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm, yeah. ; Therapist: So again, what would your goal be here? ; Therapist: What do you want to change through counseling? ; Patient: I guess my worry. ; Patient: It doesn't make me feel good. ; Therapist: You want to worry less? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: I don't want to be sick. ; Patient: I don't want to be mentally ill either. ; Therapist: All right, so you've had worry for at least a year, specifically about being physically ill. ; Therapist: There have been no findings of physical illness, but you're still worried about it. ; Therapist: And you might be a little worried that you have a mental health disorder. ; Patient: Yeah, I think something might be off. ; Patient: Something might be going on. ; Therapist: And you want to be able to stop worrying about the physical health disorders? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm, yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Are you worried right now that you have a physical health disorder? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What disorder do you think you might have now? ; Patient: Cancer, I think. ; Patient: Some part of my body that is worried that it's spreading. ; Therapist: And you've been tested for this by your physician? ; Patient: Yeah, but sometimes tests don't find things. ; Therapist: Are you ever reassured when you get negative test results back, when they say there's nothing going on? ; Patient: No, I think they might have missed something. ; Patient: My family physician, she's really frustrated with me because she won't even see me anymore, honestly. ; Patient: She's not very nice when I go in. ; Patient: But I want her to do those tests again. ; Therapist: You want her to rerun tests? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And look again? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, you're open to counseling here? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, I think maybe you can help me a little bit and find out what's wrong and what's going on. ; Therapist: Would you be okay signing release so that I could talk to your physician? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, I'll get you scheduled. ; Therapist: Now, I'll schedule you either way, whether you want to sign a release or not. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: But that's just something I think might be helpful for me to better understand what's going on. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: But I'll get you in to see a counselor. ; Therapist: It'll just take a couple days. ; Therapist: We'll get that worked out now. ; Therapist: Okay, great. ; Patient: All right? ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, this is Dr. Grande. ; Therapist: I hope you find this video useful. ; Therapist: If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel. ; Therapist: As always, thanks for watching. ; Therapist: Let's say you go into a house. ; Therapist: Do you go into the community? ; Therapist: Do you go into a house and have an off day? ; Therapist: Maybe worried about making mistakes, maybe stressed about that, maybe tired. ; Therapist: And there's some evidence there that you should be able to pick up, but you just don't. ; Therapist: Somebody lies to you about what the conditions there are, and you kind of realize that they might not be telling the truth, but you're ready to get home. ; Therapist: So you leave and then somebody's hurt. ; Therapist: Would that be kind of a worst case? ; Therapist: That's the type of mistake you're afraid of making. ; Therapist: What would that feel like to make that mistake? ; Patient: It would feel terrible. ; Patient: It would feel like, you know, I had a role in that kind of thing happening to somebody. ; Patient: Like, it was... I'm partially to blame for somebody being harmed. ; Patient: And that is like the exact opposite of what my job is supposed to be. ; Therapist: If there were to be a worst case outcome, you would be extremely upset. ; Therapist: You're extremely upset now. ; Therapist: Well, you're a 5 out of 10 right now, but you're an 8 when you're in bed in the morning. ; Therapist: Is it reasonable that a professional makes a mistake like that? ; Therapist: This is a mistake of kind of missing something that normally would be caught. ; Therapist: Is it reasonable that they continue on in the field and try to learn from that? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean... ; Patient: I'd like to think that... I guess it's not possible to make that kind of mistake, but I think that that's naive. ; Patient: I think it is possible. ; Patient: And I would like to learn from that, but I don't know what other people would do. ; Patient: Like, I don't know if I would lose my job or anything. ; Therapist: Right, there might be consequences for that type of error. ; Therapist: It's not intentional. ; Therapist: Something that, like many mistakes, would happen due to a confluence of circumstances. ; Therapist: You being tired, it being the end of the day, them not being honest. ; Therapist: There's mitigation there. ; Therapist: But still, I can appreciate you wouldn't want to make that mistake either way. ; Therapist: After making a mistake like that, what would your thought be? ; Therapist: What would you be thinking? ; Patient: I would be thinking, I don't know how this will ever be better. ; Patient: I don't know how I'm ever going to feel okay about what I did. ; Therapist: So by extension, I'll never feel okay about what I did. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And what do you think you would do then in terms of your reaction to that thought? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, I guess ideally I would say to myself it's going to get better, and this will pass and everything, but I don't know. ; Patient: It's just hard. ; Therapist: What do you think it would do to your work performance? ; Patient: I think I would probably have to take some time off. ; Patient: I mean, it's just like I would be so stressed afterwards. ; Patient: I'm worried I would make another mistake because I'm so stressed out and having trouble focusing. ; Therapist: So, in a strange way, the anxiety, the thoughts you're having now, and the resulting anxiety are leaving you more at risk to make a mistake. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I guess I never thought about it like that, although that makes a lot of sense. ; Patient: Like, if I just calm down and try to let it go, then I'll do my job better and I won't have that risk as much. ; Patient: But if I keep feeling like this, I'm not focusing, and then I could make a bigger mistake because of it. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So, one of the thoughts you're having now is, I can't make a mistake because it would be too devastating. ; Therapist: And that type... Is that kind of a thought that you're having? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, it's like, I can't make a mistake. ; Therapist: And this is leaving you emotionally less prepared, and probably increased risk of making a mistake.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, Lucy. ; Therapist: Nice to meet you. ; Patient: Hi. ; Therapist: So I understand that you were referred here by your GP because you've been feeling quite down recently. ; Patient: Yeah, I thought I should. ; Patient: I've been feeling quite bad for quite a while. ; Patient: So I thought maybe it's time to see someone about it because I don't want to feel like this anymore. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So from your notes, I saw that you saw the GP about three months ago. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So how long have you been feeling down altogether? ; Patient: Quite a few months before that as well, actually. ; Patient: But it's gotten pretty bad these past few months. ; Patient: So that's kind of why I came. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So has it got worse since you saw your GP? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So tell me, how are things at the moment? ; Patient: Well, it kind of started just feeling a bit low and wound up about things. ; Patient: But I don't know, just recently I just can't really be bothered to do anything at all. ; Patient: I kind of find it hard to get motivated for things. ; Patient: And I want to be, I really want to be better, but it's just kind of reaching the end now where I just want to do something about it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you said that you're feeling really down, really sad. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you feel like you haven't got any motivation. ; Therapist: But, are you okay? ; Patient: Yeah, I'm fine. ; Patient: Sorry. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And you haven't got any motivation, but it sounds like you put quite a lot of pressure on yourself to try and feel a bit better. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I just, it's kind of hard as well because there's not really anyone to talk to about it. ; Patient: So I just kind of stay on my own trying to, I don't like to think about it, but I don't know. ; Therapist: So you say you've been, you're feeling quite isolated. ; Therapist: There's not many people around. ; Patient: Yeah, there's no one I can talk to about it. ; Patient: No one would listen or understand anyway. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I'm just going to try and find out a little bit more about you. ; Therapist: So I understand that you're an English student at uni. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you live away from home with some friends. ; Therapist: Is that right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I live here. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you don't live far from the uni. ; Therapist: But you say you feel like you live with your friends, but you don't feel like you can talk to them. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, they're lovely. ; Patient: I get on really well with them, but I don't know. ; Patient: I just recently, whenever they want to go out or stuff, I just, I don't want to bring them down. ; Patient: I can't, they don't understand what I'm going through. ; Patient: They kind of, I don't know, they don't make fun of how I feel, but they don't really understand what it's like. ; Patient: I just, I don't want to go out with them and bring them down or stuff. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds, do you try and hide the way you're feeling from them? ; Patient: I guess. ; Patient: I mean, it's easier to hide it than to try and explain it all the time when no one really wants to know. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you've been feeling down. ; Therapist: You've been feeling unmotivated. ; Therapist: You feel like you want to be better, but actually it sounds like you feel like you can't reach out for help. ; Therapist: You can't speak to anybody. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I don't really talk to my parents a lot either. ; Patient: So that's kind of hard. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm just going to go back in time a little bit. ; Therapist: I suppose I'm just wondering when, when did all of this start? ; Therapist: You said it's been going on for quite a few months. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Um, I guess it kind of started, uh, when I was actually, when I was revising for my exams, um, I guess the stress, I put a lot of stress on myself. ; Patient: I think I've always wanted to do well for me and I guess for my parents. ; Patient: So the stress of exams and it was also kind of hard because my parents were going through a bit of a troubled time then. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So this would be like last March, last April? ; Patient: Uh, yeah, I think so. ; Therapist: Around that time. ; Therapist: So about six months-ish. ; Therapist: And it sounds like a lot was happening. ; Therapist: So you had a lot of uni pressure on and, um, and you said that your parents were having marital problems. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And it sounds like that was a real shock to you. ; Patient: Yeah, I guess it was hard as well because I wasn't doing well at uni. ; Patient: I guess I just felt a bit guilty. ; Patient: I know it sounds silly, but I felt like maybe if I could do better, then they would get better. ; Patient: But it just wasn't really happening. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you were trying to work hard and be more successful because you thought that that would make them happier and try and fix things. ; Patient: Yeah, I wanted to make them feel better, but it just kind of backfired a little, I guess. ; Therapist: How did it backfire? ; Patient: It just ended up with them getting worse and I've just been feeling worse since then. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So after the summer, after the exam period, and how did that exam period go for you in the end? ; Patient: Not very well. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's an awful lot of pressure to put on yourself. ; Therapist: I suppose to think... ; Patient: It's just annoying because I know I should have done better and I just didn't. ; Patient: And I guess I beat myself up a lot about it. ; Therapist: So you say, I know, I know I should have done better. ; Therapist: I mean, I suppose hearing it from my perspective, I'm thinking it sounds like you had an awful lot going on at the time. ; Therapist: It'd be understandable, absolutely, that you wouldn't do as well as normal. ; Therapist: I suppose I'm just wondering if you have very high standards for yourself. ; Patient: Probably maybe more than other people. ; Patient: My parents have always kind of taught me, not in a loving way, I guess, but that you should do your best, but also get the best. ; Patient: And I agree with that. ; Patient: I think that's the right thing to think. ; Patient: But when I don't do that, I don't know. ; Patient: It annoys me a lot and I worry that it annoys them. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you feel you should always do your best. ; Therapist: Is that the word you used? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that there isn't any kind of exceptions for that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I can see then that that was a really difficult time for you. ; Therapist: And that was when your mood started to get lower and things are still quite bad now. ; Therapist: I mean, what's the situation with your parents at the moment? ; Patient: I think it doesn't sound good. ; Patient: I don't really talk to them a lot, but I don't think they're going through very good. ; Patient: I don't like to talk to them about it because it just makes me feel worse. ; Patient: But I don't think it's getting any better. ; Therapist: Were you home over the summer? ; Patient: For a little bit, yeah. ; Therapist: And how was that? ; Patient: Not very fun. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: It was quite tense all the time. ; Patient: It stressed me out more than relaxed me over the summer, I guess. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds then like quite a lot has been happening. ; Therapist: You've been feeling very low. ; Therapist: You've had uni pressure on. ; Therapist: You've had problems with your parents' marriage. ; Therapist: And it sounds like you feel like you can't really reach out to anyone, like you can't understand, but you can't really reach out to your parents right now. ; Therapist: You can't really confide in your friends. ; Therapist: So I suppose I'm just wondering if you can tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling, I mean, say this past week. ; Patient: Really not good, to be honest. ; Patient: I actually, if I don't have to, then I don't really leave the house or get out of. ; Patient: But I just, I can't find the motivation for the things I used to join. ; Patient: I used to love doing sports or going out, and now I just prefer to lie in bed and not really do anything. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I missed a few lectures this week that I should have gone to, but... ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So I suppose I'm just wondering then, let's see if we can think about one thing, say a lecture. ; Therapist: What kind of thoughts do you have about going to that lecture before it happens? ; Patient: I don't really see the point anymore. ; Patient: If I can't do as well as I should be doing, then what's the point in putting myself in those positions? ; Patient: I just, I can't be bothered anymore to try. ; Patient: It just stresses me out more than I need to. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like the kind of thoughts you've got in your head are, it's pointless, it's not worth it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you have any other thoughts in your head when you're just at that point before you go to the lecture? ; Patient: I feel like, I don't know, I don't really even deserve to be here if I can't do well enough. ; Patient: I see all these other students who are doing well and doing better and want to be there. ; Patient: I don't know why I'm here even at uni, to be honest. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you feel like you're not as good as other people here. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm just, sorry, is it okay if I take notes as we go through? ; Therapist: It's just I'm trying to, I guess, understand what you're telling me and it helps me just to write it down and I'll share this with you later. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like those are some quite negative thoughts to have. ; Therapist: You're kind of saying, you know, it feels like it's pointless, it's more effort than it's worth, and I don't deserve to be here. ; Therapist: I mean, when you have those thoughts, how do you feel? ; Patient: Very unworthy probably would be the best way to put it, kind of, I don't know, lower than normal. ; Patient: Because then it makes me think about all the things that I should have been doing better. ; Therapist: Okay, so what you described there then, you said, I'm unworthy, I should be doing lots of things better. ; Therapist: Those are kind of what I would call thoughts, actually. ; Therapist: I suppose I'm trying to understand what it feels like in your gut. ; Therapist: What kind of emotions do you feel? ; Therapist: Happier? ; Therapist: Do you feel sad? ; Therapist: What kind of emotions are you feeling when you have those thoughts? ; Patient: Sad. ; Patient: Not happiness. ; Patient: No, sad. ; Patient: A bit of anger and frustration as well. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I know you're just kind of telling me this, and I know this is quite a heavy topic, but you're kind of laughing. ; Therapist: And I suppose I wonder a little bit, are you a bit, you know, how do you feel about having these emotions, talking about these emotions? ; Patient: I guess, embarrassed. ; Patient: I've never yet talked about it, so it's quite uncomfortable to be in this situation. ; Therapist: Okay, well you're doing a great job, because I know that this can be difficult. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like some of the thoughts you're describing are, it's pointless, it's more than it's worth, I don't deserve to be here, I'm unworthy. ; Therapist: And those kind of thoughts, it sounds like they just flip through your mind. ; Therapist: And then you're kind of describing different emotions that those lead to. ; Therapist: You're kind of describing sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed. ; Therapist: What about in your body, what happens? ; Therapist: How do you feel, kind of physically? ; Patient: I used to be, I think from those emotions, very wound up, very kind of stressed all the time. ; Patient: But recently it's just been a lot more draining than anything. ; Patient: Just quite lethargic, and I just can't be bothered anymore, and my body reflects that. ; Patient: But then when I try and sleep I just can't seem to have a satisfied night's sleep. ; Patient: It's really, really frustrating. ; Therapist: So it sounds like this is affecting you, it's draining you of your energy, like your body can't be bothered. ; Therapist: I think that's a really good way of describing it. ; Therapist: And you're noticing sleep problems as well. ; Therapist: And then, what do you do? ; Therapist: So this is, so we're back to the point before the lecture. ; Therapist: So you start having these thoughts, these emotions, and you know, your body, I guess it sounds like those thoughts are quite draining, so it'll be draining your energy. ; Therapist: What then happens, what do you do next? ; Patient: I kind of focus on the negative thoughts, and I probably should not think about them, ; Patient: but I focus on them and then I don't really want to do anything. ; Patient: I kind of stay in bed or... ; Therapist: So you think even more about those kind of worries that you have, so you do a bit of dwelling and you stay in bed. ; Therapist: And it sounds like you don't, you haven't tried speaking to your friends about it. ; Patient: No, I haven't. ; Therapist: Or speaking to family. ; Therapist: Okay, and then after you've done that, so after you've not gone to the lecture, you've stayed in bed, you've kind of spent time, as you said, focusing on those thoughts, those negative thoughts. ; Therapist: How do you feel after that? ; Therapist: Do you feel better or do you feel worse? ; Patient: I guess I feel slightly worse, but then a bit numb, in a way, kind of, I don't know. ; Patient: Once you've felt that, because I do feel tired all the time, I just try and push it out and then you don't really think about anything, and it's almost nicer that way than to keep focusing on how much you're getting wrong and how much you can't do stuff. ; Patient: Sometimes it's better just to not think about it at all. ; Therapist: So it sounds like in some ways it's a bit of a relief to do that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But in other ways maybe you think it might make things worse. ; Patient: Probably in the long run, yeah.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Now, one thing I thought we might do today is to get an example of one of these situations in which you get really anxious and try to see if we can understand more about how you think and how you feel when you're in the middle of one of those situations. ; Therapist: So can you think of an example of something that's happened recently? ; Patient: My daughter has been, she's actually been sick, and so she had a fever yesterday and they started her on an antibiotic and I had to go pick it up from the drugstore. ; Patient: And that's like, I don't usually go there. ; Patient: It's hard to get there. ; Patient: Like, it's not right in the neighborhood. ; Patient: So... ; Therapist: Any expressways or bridges to get there? ; Patient: Not expressways, but it's busy. ; Patient: It's busier and it's like in a mall, so you know, there's like... ; Therapist: Any four lanes or a six lane? ; Patient: Four lanes, yeah. ; Therapist: Four lane. ; Patient: So it just, it's not someplace I usually would go. ; Patient: And if I was going to go, usually I would either have her go with me or my husband go with me. ; Patient: But she was sick and he was at work and... ; Therapist: So to try to understand what goes through your mind, let's try to take you back. ; Therapist: And now you know that the prescription's there and your daughter's sick and I guess you don't want to ask her to drive over there. ; Patient: I sort of did. ; Therapist: Yeah, probably not the wisest idea. ; Therapist: So you're thinking about doing the drive and what's going through your mind? ; Therapist: What are the thoughts that are churning inside? ; Patient: I'm just, you know, I'm sort of thinking about going there and I'm already starting to think, well, you know, what if, you know, what if... ; Therapist: What if what? ; Patient: I'm driving and somebody crashes into me? ; Patient: What if I'm driving and I can't do it? ; Patient: You know, what if I just have to stop because I can't do it anymore? ; Patient: And, you know, it was raining and I'm sort of like I've got this picture of myself like out in the middle of the road and, you know... ; Therapist: What's the picture look like? ; Therapist: You're out in the middle of the road and it's raining. ; Patient: I'm stranded and it's dark and my, you know, it's, you know, my shoes are gone. ; Patient: I'm just like, it's like I, it would be a million miles to get back home. ; Therapist: Pretty miserable. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Pretty scary. ; Patient: Oh, terrifying. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: And I just, it's so hard to get there. ; Therapist: And Kate, as you put yourself back into that situation and have those thoughts going through your mind, what kinds of feelings go along with it? ; Therapist: You know, by feelings, I mean, things are inside like fear... ; Patient: Like the physical? ; Therapist: Anxiety, physical things are going on. ; Patient: Well, fear and anxiety and I just feel really shaky and I feel really like lightheaded and dizzy and I just don't feel like I can breathe very well and I feel like I'm gonna like fall over. ; Therapist: Is this a panic attack now? ; Therapist: You told me about having some panic attacks. ; Patient: I've had worse ones, but it's getting there. ; Therapist: Not quite to a panic, but you know, it's brewing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah, it feels like it might. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Well, what I think we might do to try to move things along toward getting a plan of attack on this... ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: ...is to actually sketch this out. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And see if we can figure out some things we might be able to start doing to give you a better handle on it that you have right now. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So let's put some boxes here and one of them is gonna be event. ; Therapist: These are the things that trigger your anxiety. ; Therapist: And in this case, the event was... ; Patient: The driving, having to drive to the... ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: ...to the pharmacy. ; Therapist: Drive to pharmacy. ; Therapist: And then this next box I'm gonna label something we call automatic thoughts. ; Therapist: And by automatic, I mean that they occur relatively automatically. ; Therapist: They just sort of pop into your mind and you don't stop to check them out. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we all have these kinds of automatic thoughts. ; Therapist: You know, I have them, everybody I know has them. ; Therapist: They're inner thoughts. ; Therapist: In fact, if you think about it for a minute, we probably have a lot more thoughts we don't speak out loud that are part of our inner dialogue than thoughts we actually end up speaking aloud to other people. ; Therapist: And I suspect that you have lots of those thoughts and you just gave me some examples of them. ; Therapist: So that's why we call them automatic. ; Patient: So the... ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: ...like the what ifs. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So let's put a couple of those down in this box. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: In the automatic thought box. ; Therapist: And they are... ; Patient: What if someone runs into me? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: What if... what else? ; Patient: What if I get stranded? ; Therapist: Get stranded. ; Patient: Um, I can't do it. ; Therapist: I can't do it. ; Therapist: And there was this image about the rainstorm and you don't have your shoes on and so forth. ; Therapist: What should we put down for that? ; Patient: I think what if I... what if I can't get back home? ; Therapist: I can't get back home. ; Therapist: Sort of lost. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: What if I end up on this road forever? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And then we're going to put another box. ; Therapist: There's a sort of a chain of events here. ; Patient: Uh-huh. ; Therapist: The event can make you think in ways that stir up feelings of anxiety and so forth. ; Therapist: So if you're thinking like this, it makes sense that you'd be feeling pretty nervous inside and you might have some of these physical reactions. ; Therapist: So let's put those in here. ; Therapist: This is the emotions box. ; Therapist: And they are much shaky, you said. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: A lot of fear. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: If we're going to rate that fear on a zero to 100 scale and zero is none at all and 100 is the maximum anyone could ever get, where would you be at this point? ; Patient: Oh, I'd say about an 80. ; Therapist: 80 ; Therapist: Pretty high. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's gone higher though, I suspect. ; Patient: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: But at this point it's an 80. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And then you had some other feelings inside? ; Patient: Well, yeah. ; Patient: I sort of felt like I might fall over. ; Therapist: What else? ; Patient: My heart was pounding and I didn't feel like I couldn't breathe very well. ; Therapist: How about your stomach? ; Therapist: Any flip-flops in your stomach or anything like that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So a lot going on here. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And a pretty high level of distress. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And then we're going to complete this loop by putting a box we're going to call behavior. ; Therapist: This is how you actually acted when you were in the situation. ; Therapist: So what did you do after you had these thoughts and you had these feelings? ; Patient: I went to the pharmacy. ; Therapist: You did do it? ; Patient: I had to. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what was it like for you when you were going to the pharmacy and driving there? ; Patient: It was so bad. ; Patient: I just, you know, I think I left permanent marks on the steering wheel because I was holding on to it so tight. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So in this case you actually did go to the pharmacy. ; Therapist: But you maybe did some damage to the steering wheel. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I hope not. ; Patient: But I really had no choice. ; Patient: I mean, I think usually I wouldn't go to the pharmacy. ; Patient: Usually I would call my husband and say, can you pick it up on your way home? ; Therapist: Get an escape route if you would. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So usually you would avoid this. ; Therapist: If we looked at this as a model for many of these situations about driving and feeling anxious, the usual behavior would be to try to get out of it or avoid it. ; Therapist: Is that right? ; Patient: Oh, yeah. ; Patient: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: And so if you do avoid it, then what happens? ; Patient: Well, I feel better. ; Therapist: You feel better? ; Patient: It's like such a relief. ; Therapist: Better relief. ; Therapist: The emotions calm down now, right? ; Patient: Well, yeah, because I don't have to worry about it. ; Therapist: So that's what happens for a single episode of this anxiety. ; Therapist: I'm wondering, though, if we look at the impact on you of avoiding and getting relief overall as far as managing driving, what do you think it does there? ; Patient: Well, I feel like I don't really have much confidence when it comes to this, to being able to do it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So in a way, it decreases your confidence over time. ; Patient: I think so. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I suspect that not doing it repeatedly gives you this belief about your capacity to do these driving things. ; Therapist: And what's that belief? ; Patient: Yeah, I don't feel like I can do it. ; Therapist: I can't do it. ; Patient: I can't do it. ; Patient: I can't do it. ; Patient: And I don't do it. ; Therapist: So it really comes back to this thought, I can't do it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you can't do it and you don't do it. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So here's this chain of events. ; Therapist: Events trigger thoughts. ; Therapist: We call them automatic thoughts. ; Therapist: And then they influence your emotions, these feelings you have. ; Therapist: And then that influences how you handle the situation. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Now let's think together for a moment before we wrap up of what's happening in this and before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this. ; Therapist: So let's take a look at these thoughts for a minute. ; Therapist: Do you know anybody else that drives regularly that might think differently than you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What would be an example? ; Patient: I mean, I think almost everybody. ; Patient: I think most people drive without too much problem. ; Patient: But my sister loves to drive. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, she drives every opportunity she gets. ; Therapist: So for some reason, we don't know exactly why, but the key thing here is not looking at why, but to help you with actually making change in this. ; Therapist: But you do have some differences in the way you think about driving that might be something that we could begin to work on in our sessions. ; Therapist: We might, for example, check it out. ; Therapist: What's the chances of someone slamming into you? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Or what's the chances of you being stranded out there on the highway? ; Therapist: And even if you were stranded, is there a way you could cope with that or manage that so you can get back home? ; Therapist: So these are some things that we could begin to do. ; Patient: Yeah. Okay. ; Therapist: So I'm going to mark here, we could work on these thoughts. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then by working on the thoughts, we might be able to help you reduce the emotions. ; Therapist: But there are also some things that I might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have. ; Patient: Oh, that would be really nice. ; Therapist: To be able to calm yourself down in situations. ; Therapist: So we'll have some, try to build some skills to manage your emotions. ; Therapist: And then on this behavior side, one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up. ; Therapist: And again, build your skills to do it. ; Therapist: And I can see that that causes a little bit of edginess here. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What were you thinking when I mentioned that? ; Patient: I was thinking that I hope that this doesn't make me worse. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Like trying to do some of these things. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, I'm glad you gave me that feedback. ; Therapist: That's an example, by the way, of me wanting to hear from you about the way you're responding to what I'm saying. ; Therapist: I certainly wouldn't want to do anything to make you worse. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But it causes you too much anxiety. ; Therapist: And what we'll try to do is pace it just to the level that's right for you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So that you can make some progress and get to the place you want to be, which is to be able to drive to your new office, cross that big bridge, and maybe even drive those couple of hours to... ; Patient: Visit my son. ; Therapist: Visit your son. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So what do you think? ; Patient: Well, I think that that would... ; Patient: If I could do those things, it would be really nice. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I think it'd be really nice too. ; Therapist: So that would be our goal. ; Patient: Yeah.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Vanessa, hi. ; Therapist: It's nice to see you again. ; Patient: It's good to see you. ; Therapist: Yeah, how are you? ; Patient: I'm doing okay. ; Patient: You know, things have been settling down a bit, I think. ; Therapist: Yeah, the last time we saw, things were pretty chaotic and hectic when you were being released from the, discharged from the hospital about a week ago. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How's your injury? ; Patient: It's pretty pain, you know, had a lot of pain in it. ; Patient: I've been kind of trying not to take too much pain medication and just kind of trying to keep busy and focus on things that are happening. ; Patient: I've been busy with my church duties and with my kids. ; Therapist: You've been trying to stay busy? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: It's been hard to think about myself when I have so many other things that are way more important than me to deal with. ; Therapist: How are your kids doing? ; Patient: They're doing okay. ; Patient: You know, the little ones were pretty kind of stressed out when I first got home and they were a little unsure of themselves and what was going to happen, but the older kids have helped out quite a bit, so I think they're pulling together. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I imagine that there's some, you know, period of readjustment and healing and sadness or as in, it sounds like also just trying to get things done. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, my motto is just to keep moving, you know, moving as fast as I can, trying to get, you know, keep the house clean and be good, you know, with my duties with my church and trying to keep the kids focused on their activities and not to be too focused on what's happening in me and Paul's life because, you know, there's nothing they can do about that. ; Therapist: So you're taking care of a lot of people, your community, your kids, all the while trying to take care of yourself. ; Therapist: That's a lot. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate and how much you have going on. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, you know, last time that we met, you had talked about how important it is for you to do what you can to keep your kids and yourself safe. ; Therapist: And I was wondering if you'd be interested in talking a little bit more about that today or perhaps if there's something else that you would rather talk about. ; Patient: No, I, you know, I made time today to talk about this. ; Patient: I think it's really important to try to figure something out. ; Patient: Things got very out of hand there. ; Patient: And so it's, I'm looking forward to thinking about what things I can do. ; Therapist: So you were scared. ; Therapist: It sounds like you were scared. ; Patient: It was terrifying. ; Patient: I mean, we, police were called, you know, we ended up having to call the police and Paul was arrested and spent some time in jail. ; Patient: I had child welfare folks crawling all over my house and my mom was upset and neighbors were all being nosy and gossiping. ; Patient: And it was just very scary. ; Therapist: So a lot of things were turned upside down. ; Therapist: And when you say it was scary, I hear you saying on some level it was scary for you and your safety, but it also sounds like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I mean, it was, you know, we had people come into the house calling and, you know, checking in, are you okay? ; Patient: Or can you get a restraining order? ; Patient: And my mom was trying to get me to move in with her and, you know, it's just too many, you know, too many cooks in the kitchen. ; Therapist: So a lot of people ; Therapist: have some ideas about what you should be doing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: So I'm just really, I'm not, I'm not going to do that. ; Patient: I'm not going to get a restraining order. ; Patient: I'm not going to call the police. ; Patient: You know, he knows where I live. ; Therapist: So say more about that. ; Therapist: Say more about why you, why you don't want to call the police or you don't want to get a restraining order. ; Patient: They were, they were throwing him on the ground. ; Patient: They were holding his arms behind his back and, and they had their guns and, you know, that kind of, you never know what the police are going to do to a black man. ; Patient: You never know whether he's going to make it to the jail safely. ; Patient: So I was, I was terrified for him. ; Patient: And then the next day, you know, child welfare call in the house. ; Therapist: It sounds like that was a very scary experience and moment for you. ; Patient: Yeah, because I'm a good mom. ; Therapist: And given that experience, you're, it sounds like you're probably, you're maybe not as inclined to think about calling the police again. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: No, no. ; Patient: I've, I've told my mom that that's, you know, that's a last resort and that I'm going to be meeting with some folks and thinking about other options. ; Therapist: And that's what you'd like to talk about today, is alternatives to calling the police. ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Therapist: Well, what have you thought about so far? ; Therapist: What other ideas do you have about what you might do in a serious moment where you're scared for your, your wellbeing and that of your kids? ; Patient: I think I'm most afraid, you know, that something might happen that will be really crazy and really out of control. ; Patient: And so I've been thinking about what kinds of things I could do if things are crazy and out of control. ; Patient: And I've just thought about maybe talking to somebody or talking to my minister about it. ; Patient: It came to my mind because he's somebody who we've talked to before. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So your minister, someone that you're thinking about, talking to a little bit about what's going on in your relationship. ; Therapist: What are your thoughts? ; Therapist: What would you, what would you say to your minister? ; Therapist: What would you like to tell your minister? ; Patient: I'm really, I'm really interested in telling him more of the truth of what's happening in my relationship. ; Patient: He doesn't know about, he has no idea that Paul has threatened to kill me and they threatened to kill himself and the children. ; Patient: He knows we've had some marital problems, some financial problems. ; Patient: He knows that Paul's had some drinking problems. ; Patient: So there's some of that, but he doesn't know about him threatening to kill us or that he's been hitting me or his rages. ; Patient: So I feel like, you know, that it's time to tell the minister, you know, tell him some of that stuff. ; Therapist: You feel like you've been keeping some significant information from your, what would be some reasons why you would tell him these things? ; Therapist: What might be some advantages or reasons to do that? ; Patient: He's been helpful before. ; Patient: He's really helped us a lot. ; Patient: We've, we've had counseling with him over the last five years, numerous times, and he's been very helpful. ; Therapist: So it's someone that you trust, someone that you ; Therapist: have a relationship with, and he's been helpful. ; Therapist: In what ways has he been helpful? ; Patient: You know, I think Paul respects him as a man and I think he cares about Paul. ; Patient: So he's not, you know, my mom and my dad and my friends, they, they're, they're really bordering on hating Paul and they don't, I don't feel like they have any objectivity when it comes to working with him. ; Patient: But my pastor has some objectivity and I think he cares about Paul. ; Therapist: It sounds like your pastor is able to see him as a whole complicated human being in the same ways that, that you do, perhaps, that there's this side of him that's scary and that you don't like, and then there's this other aspect of him that you, you really do appreciate and you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well. ; Therapist: What would be another reason to talk to your pastor in addition to this being someone you trust and that Paul might listen to? ; Therapist: What would be another advantage? ; Patient: Well, I don't think that he's going to likely go storming into, you know, our pastor's house. ; Patient: Paul, Paul won't. ; Patient: That Paul won't, you know, he's going to, you know, he comes banging at my mom's door and he goes, you know, storming over to my girlfriend's house, but he's not likely to do that. ; Patient: Yeah, I don't think he will. ; Therapist: So, so, so your pastor's home actually might be a physically safe place for you all to go, ; Patient: right, should things get cool off because things got so out of control and crazy, you know, and, and that's not going to happen again. ; Therapist: So you've said that a few times now that things got so out of control and crazy. ; Therapist: Tell me, tell me a little bit more about how, what that was. ; Patient: You know, you know, my eldest son got involved. ; Patient: My arm was, was, was harmed. ; Patient: Things were broken. ; Patient: He threatened to kill me and he threatened to kill all of us. ; Patient: And I had to call the police and I had to, you know, have people coming into my house, tromping through my house, grabbing Paul, hurting him. ; Patient: You know, he called me from jail and how can you do this? ; Patient: You know, what have you done? ; Patient: You know, I felt like, what have I done? ; Patient: How can I do this? ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So, so not only was it so scary in the heat of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your children, but afterwards it was scary as well because of all the things that happened. ; Patient: All that fallout. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, so, so going to your pastors, talking to your pastor, possibly seeing if his house might be a place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore. ; Therapist: And those are advantages. ; Therapist: Are there any disadvantages? ; Therapist: Like what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your pastor about what's been going on in your relationship? ; Patient: That Paul will know. ; Patient: You know, if he finds out that I've talked to our minister about this, you know, I have no doubt how angry he will be. ; Therapist: So this could really be a trigger, a significant trigger. ; Patient: Yes, if he finds out about it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So that's a little bit of a difficult situation. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: As you think about this particular part of a safety plan, on the one hand, there's potentially some real advantages and positives to speaking to your minister. ; Therapist: And at the same time, there's this possible significant risk. ; Therapist: When you think about, you know, the pros and the cons in this situation, what do you, what do you make of that? ; Therapist: What do you, where do you go with that? ; Patient: It's, it's a risk I'm willing to take. ; Patient: You know, I have thought about this and it was, you know, things got so out of control and I feel like it's time to do something different and to think about how we're going to do this differently. ; Therapist: You're, you're really concerned. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: A part of you is really worried about the next time. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of the safety planning and you also feel like it's a risk that you're, you're willing to take given what is at stake. ; Therapist: And really it sounds like you feel like your life and your children's lives may be at stake. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Patient: You know, I think that things can't continue the way that they are. ; Patient: I have to figure out something that's going to work for me and for my kids and for Paul. ; Therapist: Would it be alright with you if I offered just a suggestion or a thought, something to think about in terms of kids and safety planning? ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: This is something that I know other moms in a similar, in situations similar to yours have done and that is sit down and have a conversation with their kids about identifying a safe person to either call or run to in the moment when things are, if things get really crazy and out of hand. ; Therapist: I'd be curious to hear what your thoughts are about doing that with your kids. ; Patient: I think my oldest, my oldest son, that would be a really helpful thing for him because he wants to know what he can do. ; Patient: He wants to do something. ; Patient: He's always jumping in. ; Patient: That's how I got hurt in the first place is he was jumping in. ; Patient: So helping him identify something that he can do that will keep us safe and to keep him safe would be a great idea. ; Therapist: Yeah, so you see this perhaps as a way of kind of not pulling him out of a violent situation but having him turn away from a violent situation as opposed to turn into it which is what he's done. ; Patient: Yeah, he's becoming a man now too. ; Patient: He needs to have an option of what he can do to keep his family safe. ; Therapist: And as he's becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you, you're also really concerned about protecting him and keeping him safe. ; Therapist: I've heard you identify a few things that you're thinking about doing or would like to do and things that you feel like you actually do have control over. ; Therapist: Last time we talked you were very clear about the fact that you can't control Paul when he's in his fury and his rage and being violent. ; Therapist: And what I've heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control. ; Therapist: You can't control him but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to possibly a safe person, your minister and having that conversation to see if that might be a safe person and place to go to and then the other piece is maybe having a conversation with your oldest child at least about who to call in the moment. ; Therapist: And I'm confident Vanessa that you will be able to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and I'm here to support you in any way that I can and if it's at all helpful I'd be happy to follow up with you in a few days and see if you feel the need to talk about it some more. ; Patient: Thank you I'd appreciate that. ; Therapist: Thanks for your time. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Watch what happens this time when the provider cues into what the parent is saying, empathizes with her situation, and attempts to work with the parent to find a solution that fits her needs. ; Therapist: So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden. ; Therapist: I did want to talk to you though, I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart at how many ear infections he's had recently and I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home so I was wondering if you could tell me a little more about that. ; Patient: Well, it's just me and him and I do smoke. ; Patient: I try really hard not to smoke around him. ; Patient: But I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. ; Patient: But everything is so stressful being a single mom and my having a full time job. ; Patient: So it's just, that's why I started smoking again. ; Therapist: You have a lot of things going on and smoking is kind of a way to relax and de-stress. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Some people have a glass of wine, I have a cigarette. ; Therapist: And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. ; Therapist: Why did you make that decision? ; Patient: I know it's not good for him. ; Patient: I mean I've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff. ; Patient: But other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke. ; Therapist: So on the one hand you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems. ; Patient: Right, yeah. ; Patient: I mean he doesn't have asthma. ; Patient: He hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have. ; Patient: And I've thought about quitting before in the past but I just don't see how it's possible right now. ; Therapist: What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant? ; Patient: Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that and I didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him. ; Therapist: Right now though it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try. ; Patient: Yeah, exactly. ; Therapist: How were you successful when you quit before? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I think about it now I don't even know how I did it. ; Patient: I just did it. ; Patient: I just couldn't imagine him not being born or going into labor early and him having problems and stuff like that. ; Patient: All the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. ; Patient: So that was just enough to say, okay you know what, I'm not going to risk that. ; Therapist: The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop. ; Therapist: But they don't feel as scary to you now. ; Patient: No, I mean we're two separate people and like I said I try really hard not to smoke around him. ; Patient: I'm pretty good about that. ; Patient: I don't let other people smoke around him. ; Therapist: You're doing the best you can do. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Okay, but it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit. ; Patient: Yeah, I know that I need to and I keep every new year I say, okay this year I'm going to quit smoking. ; Patient: But then something happens and it just doesn't. ; Therapist: It's on your to-do list. ; Therapist: It's just not making it to the top. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: If you did decide to quit, on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all confident and you don't think you could do it and ten is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now? ; Patient: Probably like a five. ; Patient: Kind of in the unsure area. ; Patient: I know I've done it before so I know I can do it. ; Patient: But at the same time it just seems really hard and it's not the same situation. ; Therapist: Well what made you say five rather than two or three? ; Patient: I know all the ways it's bad for me and I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. ; Patient: I don't want him to use any kind of, I don't want him to chew or anything like that. ; Patient: So I know I need to especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing but I just don't know if I can do it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. ; Therapist: You have been successful quitting in the past and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Where do you think we should go from here? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I'd like some help. ; Patient: I just don't know what kind of help I need. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: Well if you'd be interested that's something I can definitely talk to you about. ; Therapist: There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. ; Therapist: There's different medications you can try. ; Patient: I don't like medicine. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you and sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever. ; Patient: That sounds nice but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. ; Therapist: I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life. ; Patient: That would be really nice. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well if you're willing then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that. ; Patient: I would like that. ; Patient: That would be great. ; Therapist: Great. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: This time the provider had the same agenda to talk to this parent about the dangers of secondhand smoke and a counsel heard her quit smoking. ; Therapist: However, this time the provider's focus was on the parent's own view of the issue. ; Therapist: By giving the parent an opportunity to reflect on her situation the provider was able to elicit reasons for change from the parent herself. ; Therapist: There was no need to lecture or scold because the parent was making her own case against smoking. ; Therapist: Many times our patients already have the information that we try to give them. ; Therapist: What they really need is someone to listen to them and to help them sort out a plan that will fit in their life. ; Therapist: By accepting and respecting our patients, even with their faults, we communicate our genuine desire to help them make positive changes in their lives. ; Therapist: During this interaction the provider demonstrated that she understood the parent's struggle and that she still wanted to help. ; Therapist: As a result, this single parent found she finally had someone on her team. ; Therapist: This increased both her interest and willingness to try working further with the provider to find a solution that would fit in her life.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Emma, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm good, thanks. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well. ; Therapist: Thank you for asking. ; Therapist: I understand you've been having some symptoms that are bothersome to you. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about what's going on? ; Patient: I moved into my apartment about a year ago and I've been having anxious thoughts and sometimes I'm scared I'm going to lose my apartment. ; Therapist: So you've been having anxiety, you've been having thoughts about possibly losing your apartment. ; Therapist: Tell me more about that. ; Patient: When I ran out my check for the rent, I usually would pay it online but then I would click the button and it would submit it a couple times. ; Patient: I just wanted to make sure I got paid. ; Patient: So then I started to actually go in person and pay it. ; Patient: But then I would check my statement just to make sure they cashed it and they got it. ; Therapist: To make sure they really received your payment. ; Patient: I'm also nervous that something might happen where I leave my straightener on and the apartment burns down. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself acting on that thought, say specifically that thought with the straightener? ; Patient: I'll check it and I'll just make sure that it's unplugged and then I look around and make sure everything's unplugged because I don't want anything getting caught. ; Therapist: When you say everything, what do you mean? ; Patient: The toaster, my computer, my laptop charger, my cell phone, the charger for that, and just anything that's plugged in like the television. ; Patient: I just want to make sure everything's unplugged before I leave. ; Therapist: Before you leave your apartment. ; Therapist: What do you do when you come back? ; Patient: I check to make sure they're still unplugged but then when I need to use it, I plug it back in. ; Therapist: If you need to use, for instance, television, do you plug it in and watch it and then unplug it immediately or only before you leave? ; Patient: Before I leave. ; Therapist: So you leave it plugged in while you're there. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: When did you first notice the anxiety? ; Patient: I guess like six months ago. ; Therapist: About six months ago? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How did it start out? ; Patient: It started with just thinking about things, thinking about leaving the door unlocked or being unsure if I paid bills. ; Patient: Just thinking about it and then I would have to double check it and triple check in and just kind of make sure. ; Therapist: Did it start with that? ; Therapist: Did it start with the door locks? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It started with just thinking and making sure the door was locked. ; Therapist: Do you still do that now? ; Therapist: Do you check the door several times? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I just make sure it's locked. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How do you do that? ; Therapist: Do you get up and look at it and see if it's locked and then go sit down and think about it and come back? ; Therapist: Or do you operate the mechanism back and forth? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I just go in. ; Patient: I look in and make sure it's locked and then I'll go back down and I'll just sit back down and I'll be okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: For a while? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And does that thought ever come back and you have to go check it again? ; Patient: Sometimes. ; Patient: Not really. ; Therapist: Not really. ; Patient: I'll just check in and it's fine. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you have kind of a checklist in your mind for when you leave your apartment? ; Therapist: Do you do like unplug everything in roughly the same order and check everything in a similar order? ; Patient: I haven't really thought about it but I make sure everything's unplugged. ; Patient: Like I know what needs to be unplugged. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you do have kind of a list in your mind of what has to be unplugged. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you'll make sure it's all unplugged. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: And how about when you lock your door from the outside when you're leaving? ; Therapist: Do you check that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I'll check it and then if I'm sitting in my car, I just might go back just to double check it and just make sure. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you're checking the door. ; Therapist: You're unplugging various items that may create heat. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You're careful with your paying your rent. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So fear and anxiety surrounding losing the apartment in some manner. ; Therapist: How is this affecting your daily life, these symptoms? ; Patient: Well, I mean it's time consuming. ; Patient: Sometimes I'm late for work because I think I left something plugged in and I have to go back inside. ; Patient: Sometimes I'll lock the door and have to go back and make sure it's locked. ; Patient: So I'm usually late for things because I'm double checking. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So it's causing some problems getting places on time. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about your level of anxiety or worry? ; Therapist: How high would you say that is? ; Patient: I guess it would be like high I guess, thinking about it. ; Therapist: It's troubling for you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: If you think about from when it started, it started out, it sounds like with a few thoughts, right? ; Therapist: If we say that's relative to low anxiety, yeah, how would what you have now compare to that? ; Patient: I guess moderate, like in the, a little higher. ; Therapist: Just a little higher? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: But you have noticed it's worsened over the six months. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Is it the most anxiety you've ever experienced? ; Patient: I kind of consider myself an anxious person. ; Patient: So I guess, yeah. ; Therapist: This is the most you've experienced? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So this is particularly troubling? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you said you've always been, you said anxious person? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Tell me about that. ; Patient: Just like group settings or, I remember just something when I was younger. ; Patient: I was like just playing with the door or something like that and my parents took me to some, I don't know, some doctor and they just said I was anxious. ; Therapist: Did they give you any treatment? ; Patient: I don't, no, I don't think so. ; Patient: They just said I was anxious. ; Therapist: So other than saying you're anxious, was there any diagnosis provided? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: Have you ever had any mental health diagnosis? ; Patient: Just, I guess just feeling anxious but not necessarily like a diagnosis. ; Therapist: Not from a provider? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How about any medical conditions? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: None? ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Have you ever been to the hospital or anything? ; Patient: Just to like get my tonsils taken out but not like anything else. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: How about drugs or alcohol? ; Therapist: Any usage of those? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Never? ; Patient: Uh-uh. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Emma, I'm going to have you see a counselor here. ; Therapist: I think it's just scheduled to see somebody. ; Therapist: I appreciate you taking this time with me, explaining the symptoms. ; Therapist: It's been helpful. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

; Patient: Pat's fine. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Well, it's nice to meet you. ; Patient: Nice to meet you. ; Therapist: Can you tell me why you're here today? ; Patient: I have a terrible headache. ; Therapist: It looks really bad. ; Patient: Yeah, it is. ; Therapist: Is there anything else besides your headache that you want to address here today at the clinical department? ; Patient: No, it's just that, except I am concerned. ; Patient: I just recently changed insurance companies and I'm not sure this is going to be covered yet. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Was there anything, because what we can do is while we're talking and I'm doing your history and physical, I'll have my office secretary look into the insurance plan that you have. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: So you don't have to worry about that. ; Patient: Yeah, that sounds good. ; Therapist: Okay, sounds great. ; Therapist: Is there anything else? ; Patient: No, I just, this is just really bad. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what I'd like to do today, and let's take a look at what's causing your headache. ; Therapist: I will go over history, physical, and then we'll do again a physical exam, and then we will look into your insurance policy and make sure that's all, you know, taken care of. ; Therapist: Does that sound like a good plan for you? ; Patient: That's good. ; Therapist: Perfect. ; Therapist: So tell me a little bit more about this, the head pain that you're having. ; Patient: Well, it started about three days ago, and nothing has helped it. ; Patient: It's just laid me flat. ; Patient: I haven't been able to go to work. ; Patient: Nothing's helped. ; Patient: It's all over. ; Patient: It's really bad when I move, so I'm trying not to move too much, and the light is bothering me a lot. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Unfortunately, I can't dim the lights in this room, but I'll try to go quickly, and it would be okay if I took some notes. ; Patient: Oh, sure. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you said this headache started about three days ago. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Was there anything that brought it on, anything unusual that happened maybe three days ago? ; Patient: Not really, no. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Can you tell me anything that makes it better? ; Patient: Nothing's made it better. ; Patient: I took some Tylenol. ; Patient: I tried Motrin. ; Patient: Nothing. ; Patient: I just try not to move too much. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Is there anything that makes it worse? ; Patient: Yeah, movement and light. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And it's just constant, though. ; Patient: It's just constant. ; Patient: It's all over. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So if you had to rate it on a pain scale, zero being no pain, 10 being the worst pain you ever had. ; Patient: It's a 10. ; Therapist: A 10? ; Patient: Yeah, it's a headache like this. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah, that sounds really bad. ; Therapist: Now, as far as radiation, does that move? ; Therapist: You said the pain is all up here in the front of your head? ; Patient: It's kind of all over. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: But also, I've got this shooting pain down my neck, and my neck is very stiff. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: But it's not, it's the entire head. ; Therapist: Entire head? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: As far as in the timing, you said that it started three days ago, but you said it's a constant. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It comes and goes. ; Patient: It started gradually, but once it got there, it hasn't gone away. ; Patient: It doesn't get better. ; Patient: It doesn't get worse. ; Patient: It's just the same. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what I want to get is your perception of what you think is going on. ; Patient: Oh, I don't know. ; Patient: I just, I can hardly think. ; Patient: It's so painful. ; Patient: I just, because it's so bad, I was afraid. ; Patient: My neighbor had a headache and ignored it last year, and he suddenly started having seizures and it turns out he had a brain tumor, so I thought I just should come in and look ; Patient: at it. ; Therapist: Yeah, I can understand your concern. ; Therapist: How is it impacting your daily life? ; Patient: I can't go to work. ; Patient: I can't do anything. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds like it's really impacting your life. ; Patient: Yeah, I can't. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If it's okay, I would like to go talk a little bit about your medical history and your social history. ; Patient: Okay, sure. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Can you tell me as far as your medical history, do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of? ; Patient: I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about three years ago, but we've been addressing it with diet changes and it's been monitored. ; Therapist: Okay, so it's controlled with diet? ; Patient: Yeah, I go in yearly, I had been just, and it's been well controlled, so I haven't been on medication. ; Therapist: No meds for that. ; Patient: But other than that, I haven't had any problems. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Any surgical history? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Any hospitalizations? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And you said the only medicine you're taking was Tylenol and Montreux, but it doesn't help? ; Patient: Yeah, and they didn't help, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I just wanted to verify. ; Therapist: Do you have any drug allergies? ; Patient: No, no. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What about family history? ; Therapist: Do you have any medical history of headaches or- ; Patient: In my family? ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: What about your father's history? ; Patient: You know, my mom said she used to get migraines when she was in her 20s and 30s. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I don't remember her saying anything else about it. ; Patient: My sister, I have one sister, she's healthy. ; Patient: My dad, he has high blood pressure, but other than that, he's healthy. ; Patient: And that's about it. ; Patient: I don't have any kids. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: It's all right. ; Therapist: I would like to ask you some social history questions that, just for, there are records. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you smoke? ; Patient: Yeah, I do. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Is it cigarettes or chewing? ; Patient: Yeah, cigarettes. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And how much do you smoke? ; Patient: About a half a pack a day. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What about alcohol? ; Patient: I don't drink. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Also, are you married? ; Patient: Yeah, I'm married. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And children? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And just some additional questions is looking at your kind of GYN history, are you- Are you last menstrual period? ; Patient: Oh, I'm in menopause. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So going back into the history again, have you, you said your mom had migraines earlier on. ; Therapist: Have you been around and no other, you haven't been nauseous or have you been in other cities? ; Patient: Yeah, I've been nauseous. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: In fact, I threw up twice early on. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Because when I move, it makes me nauseous. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Nothing out of the ordinary over the past couple of weeks. ; Therapist: Have you been on any trips or anything? ; Patient: Mm. ; Therapist: Or- ; Patient: Actually, a week ago I was in North Carolina for a family reunion. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And there was a four-year-old who was sick there. ; Patient: I don't know what they had, but they- Okay. ; Patient: I guess they ended up taking him into emergency. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: So let me just summarize to make sure I've got everything straight so far is you started hitting an onset of a severe headache about three days ago. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: It's worse with movement. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Light really makes it hurt bad. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: It's a 10 out of 10 pain, and you're also complaining of a stiff neck with that. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: It came on gradually, and it's been constant pain in the frontal area. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Medical history, you're in hyper, you have high blood pressure, but that's controlled with diet. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: No surgical history, no really hospitalizations. ; Therapist: The pain, though, isn't really impacting your day-to-day living and daily life. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You tried Tylenol and Moltren, it didn't help. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Otherwise, no medications. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You've got the family history of your mom with migraines, otherwise your family is healthy. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You smoke about a half a pack a day. ; Therapist: You don't drink. ; Therapist: And then you were, you said you took a trip about a week ago? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Or two weeks ago? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah, I don't know. ; Patient: It was in North Carolina. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Yeah, I can understand your concern about your friend. ; Therapist: You said that he was having seizures. ; Patient: I've just never had this kind of pain before. ; Therapist: Yeah, and I can understand that. ; Therapist: And, you know, so what I would like to do is, we've pretty much gone over your history. ; Therapist: What I'd like to do is complete a physical exam. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do some testing. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And I want to ask, too, if there's any other concerns I need to address before we get to that final exam. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Yep, that sounds good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Sounds great. ; Patient: Okay.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Jill, how you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing okay. ; Therapist: Just okay? ; Patient: Well, I know we've talked before about me thinking about suicide and I'm starting to think about it a little bit stronger than before, I think a little bit more clearly. ; Therapist: Can you tell me a little bit more about that? ; Patient: Well, when we've talked before, I've had the feelings and the thoughts of suicide, but now it's kind of starting to like, I'm thinking about it more often. ; Patient: I'm thinking about it a little more clearly and that's alarming to me. ; Therapist: Do you want to die? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, sometimes. ; Therapist: Sometimes? ; Patient: I mean, you know, sometimes I know it would be scary to try it and my husband would be so hurt, but at the same time, I want to end this. ; Patient: I want to end the feeling that I'm having. ; Therapist: Depression? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you have any plan as to how you would end your life if you decided to do that? ; Patient: I mean, I know if I wanted to that we have pills in the cabinet, so it wouldn't be that hard. ; Patient: I could just take the bottle and... ; Therapist: The same pills that you prescribed for the depression? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you feel like you're going to carry out that plan? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I mean, part of it, that's why I'm nervous because like I'm worried that I might, but at the same time, you know, I'm afraid to. ; Patient: Sometimes I think that I might and sometimes I think I won't. ; Patient: I don't want to, but sometimes I get scared that I will. ; Therapist: Today you're a little worried that you will or you're a little closer to it than usual. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: We've talked about this before in the past. ; Therapist: You've come in, you've had kind of that same plan with the pills and the thoughts. ; Therapist: And what stopped you those times? ; Therapist: What stopped you in the past? ; Patient: In the past, I thought, this will get better. ; Patient: I just have to keep trying. ; Patient: I thought, what will my husband feel when I'm gone? ; Patient: And my family, my parents, my brother and sister. ; Patient: I thought that this is as bad as it can get and it has to get better eventually, but now I'm just starting to feel like I don't think it's going to get better. ; Therapist: All right, so those times before when you had the same feeling, right, you felt just as bad as you feel now, really down, a little hopeless. ; Therapist: What happened a few days after that, after the thoughts, suicide went away? ; Therapist: What was your outlook on life then? ; Patient: I mean, I feel a little better, you know, and then I'd say to myself, that was silly, you know. ; Patient: I don't want to do that. ; Patient: I don't want to end things, you know. ; Patient: It's too rash. ; Patient: But, you know, it's starting to feel like a permanent problem. ; Therapist: So you feel like this time, these suicidal thoughts, they're markedly different than what you've experienced before? ; Patient: I wouldn't say markedly, but I would say they're different. ; Patient: They're a little, they're stronger. ; Therapist: More intense this time? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: What do you think brought these feelings on? ; Therapist: Before we talked about it, I know this relationship, surrounding relationships, they're the same thing this time. ; Patient: I mean, I guess that has something to do with it. ; Patient: I guess it's just like when I look to everything, like everything that could be good or everything, just everything like life, my relationships, the future. ; Patient: I just look at it and I see despair. ; Patient: I just see everything going wrong and I just don't see how it could get better. ; Patient: I just don't see it. ; Therapist: You know, a sense of hopelessness. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So this time is different because you feel it's maybe less situational, less tied up to relationships and more, well, philosophical. ; Therapist: You're looking at your outlook and you're saying it's not going to get you better. ; Therapist: That's the point, don't you know what? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So this is a little bit of new territory for you. ; Therapist: How long have you been feeling this way with the intensity you have right now? ; Patient: Probably a week, maybe, no less. ; Therapist: What has prevented you from hurting yourself? ; Therapist: That was last week. ; Patient: I'm afraid to do it. ; Patient: I'm just scared. ; Patient: It's like jumping off a diving board. ; Patient: Like you get up to the edge and you stand there. ; Patient: That's where I'm at. ; Therapist: Have you made any gestures to harm yourself? ; Therapist: Like if you went and grabbed the pills or went to the medicine cabinet and looked at the pills, anything like that? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Sometimes I look at them. ; Therapist: You look at them. ; Therapist: Have you done anything further than look at them? ; Patient: Well, I mean, so I have to take them. ; Patient: It's my prescription. ; Patient: So when it's time I start thinking about it, like it's more, I think about my, like the ideations come even more because it's like a trigger. ; Patient: It's like I'm thinking about the pills. ; Patient: So I go to the cabinet and I get my pills and I take the one that I'm supposed to, but I just look at the bottle and I kind of stand there and I just think instead of putting the bottle back, I could take it with me. ; Therapist: And what do you end up doing? ; Patient: It takes a while, but I put it back. ; Patient: It's scary. ; Patient: Like I look into the bottle and I'm afraid because dying is scary, but. ; Therapist: And how about the pain that you would cause your husband and the rest of your family? ; Patient: Yeah, I don't want to do that. ; Therapist: You don't want that? ; Patient: I don't, I don't, I don't want my husband to find me. ; Patient: I don't want him to feel like this is his fault. ; Patient: I don't want him to be sad that I'm gone. ; Patient: I don't want him to feel like I feel. ; Therapist: And when relatives of somebody that committed suicide hear about the suicide, who do they blame? ; Therapist: The suicide. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And it's not their fault. ; Patient: It's not their fault. ; Patient: And I know that they wouldn't be able to get over it. ; Patient: And I know that they'll be thinking about how bad I felt. ; Patient: They'll have to know what it really felt like for me. ; Patient: So I know this is a tough time, right? ; Therapist: But the good news is you're here talking to me about it. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: And you're talking about it, I'm going to guess that you want to do something for bad to feel better. ; Therapist: Are you going to carry out your plan? ; Therapist: Are you going to hurt yourself? ; Patient: I don't want to. ; Therapist: Are you going to? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think if I can just remember what it'll be like for them that will keep me from doing it. ; Patient: You know it's the times that I forget to think about how they're going to feel, that I get closer to the edge. ; Patient: But when I remember, you know, like it upsets me to think about what it'll be like for them. ; Patient: So if I can remember to think about that, then it'll help me not do that. ; Patient: But I think having the pills there in the cabinet like that is a big temptation for me. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So can we do this? ; Therapist: Your husband's at home, as I mentioned. ; Therapist: You take the pills once a day? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Before bed? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Can we, would you be willing to sign a release so I can talk to him and he can hold onto those pills and just give you the pill each night? ; Therapist: You take one a night? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Would that be okay? ; Patient: Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. ; Therapist: Is there anything else in the medicine cabinet or anywhere else in the house that could be of danger to you? ; Patient: I think, yeah, I think it would be a good idea to just make sure that everything that was in the medicine cabinet. ; Therapist: All the pills? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Would he be willing to do that? ; Patient: Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that he would be willing to do that. ; Patient: He doesn't, he wants me to get through this. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And if I get a release to talk, I might go sign it? ; Patient: Yeah, I'll do that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I was really before, or you're familiar rather with this concept that we talked about before, contracting for safety. ; Therapist: I remember the prior times when you've been in the state. ; Therapist: Similar to this. ; Therapist: Can you promise me that you're going to not harm yourself? ; Patient: I can, yeah, I can do that. ; Patient: At least until next week when we meet again, I promise. ; Therapist: Let's be a little searing that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Set something up for Ammar. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah, I can definitely do that. ; Therapist: I can do that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: This is a rough time. ; Therapist: I'm trying to appreciate how rough it is for you. ; Therapist: I want you to keep in mind how you felt after the times before and how you do tend to pull out of this and you look back at it a lot differently, but in the moment it's hard to see that. ; Therapist: It doesn't necessarily make this any easier, but if you can hang on until we can get through this cycle of depression, you'll probably have a different outlook. ; Therapist: If history is any evidence, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Does that kind of make sense? ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, what do you have planned for the rest of the day after you leave here? ; Patient: You know, I'm just going to go home. ; Patient: My husband will be home from work and have dinner, watch TV. ; Patient: He'll be there, so. ; Therapist: Are you going to be alone at any time between when you leave here and when you come and see me tomorrow? ; Patient: Um, yeah. ; Patient: I'll probably be home for a little while in the morning, but I have to work so I won't have, you know, I'll be busy. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If these feelings intensify to where you do feel you're going to act on them, would you promise to call me? ; Therapist: If you can't get along with me, call 911? ; Patient: Yeah, I'll do that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'm going to go get that released so we can talk to your husband and then I'll see you for a few minutes and we'll set up a plan for tomorrow. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right?

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Jesse, how are you doing today? ; Patient: Not too good, Dr. Grande. ; Therapist: Not so good? ; Patient: No, I just got into a fight with my parents. ; Therapist: What's been going on? ; Patient: I've been doing heroin for a few months now. ; Patient: I didn't think my parents knew, but I guess they found a needle in my room. ; Patient: They knew what I was doing. ; Patient: They told me that I have to start shaping up and I need to stop doing any kind of drugs. ; Patient: They said the next time they find any kind of drugs, that's it. ; Patient: They're going to kick me out of the house. ; Therapist: So they're at the point where anything else happens and they discover it and you're out on the street. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: What are your feelings about being out on the street? ; Patient: I don't want to be out there. ; Patient: I don't know who would be. ; Patient: It would be hard just to stop cold turkey. ; Patient: I know a couple of buddies that did that and it's not good when you get junk sick. ; Patient: I'm kind of stuck because I don't want to be out on the streets, but it's just going to be so hard to give it up. ; Therapist: There are conflicting feelings here. ; Therapist: You don't want to be out on the street, but you don't want to give up the heroin at the same time. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I just don't want to give it up, but I kind of know I have to. ; Patient: I'm a young guy. ; Patient: I couldn't make it outside of my parents' house and I definitely don't want to be out on the streets. ; Therapist: You want to stop to avoid the consequences that could happen. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But to this point you haven't been able to? ; Patient: I guess at this point I really haven't had something that would make me. ; Patient: I've been doing it for a while and it's been pretty great, but I never really had any kind of problem with it. ; Patient: Nothing too bad has happened, so this is kind of the first time something has hit me where it's like, man, I really got to stop it. ; Therapist: So this is the first consequence or potential consequence that's motivated you since you started using. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: How strong is the craving to use? ; Patient: I mean, when I first started it was pretty freaking great. ; Patient: The rush that you get from it, it's just mind-numbing. ; Patient: It's just amazing. ; Patient: But I've noticed recently that the rush isn't as intense anymore and it's even kind of starting to backfire a little bit where I actually feel a little sick without using it. ; Patient: And that kind of scares me, but the crazy things are definitely still there. ; Therapist: So when you try to cut back, have you tried to cut back? ; Patient: I have before, but there was no reason to, so I didn't try very hard. ; Therapist: When you did try, did you have the feeling where you were getting sick? ; Patient: I did, yeah. ; Patient: It wasn't as bad as any of my buddies, but I definitely didn't feel well. ; Therapist: Have your parents given you any options in terms of, like, do they understand that it seems like you're a little dependent on...? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, they do. ; Patient: I definitely, like, I don't hold anything against my parents. ; Patient: I actually have a pretty good relationship with them. ; Patient: I know what I'm doing isn't good for me. ; Patient: And they said that they would completely support me. ; Patient: They told me that they have a place picked out where I can go and that they'd be willing to pay for it and everything. ; Patient: But they said if I don't meet them halfway, then that's it. ; Patient: They're done. ; Therapist: Alright, so they have a solution, in a sense, for what's going on. ; Therapist: Is it like a detox? ; Patient: It is, yeah. ; Therapist: So they have a solution to help get you off the heroin. ; Therapist: But is there still a part of you that doesn't want to go that route? ; Patient: I mean, I think I'm starting to come to terms that it's time to stop. ; Patient: And it might be good that maybe I'm stopping so early. ; Patient: I know my friends have been doing it for a lot longer than I have. ; Patient: But I just, I don't know if the detox is going to work. ; Patient: I mean, it's hard for me to focus on, like, anything until, sometimes until I get my next fix. ; Therapist: Alright, so there's a few problems here. ; Therapist: So one is can you commit to going to detox? ; Therapist: And the second is, even if you successfully complete that, when you come back out, you can be able to avoid the heroin. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: It's tough right now because actually my dealer lives in my neighborhood. ; Patient: I mean, he's just a few houses down. ; Patient: My girlfriend lives in our community too. ; Patient: And, like, he's on the way to her house. ; Patient: So, like, I'll kind of just maybe pick it up on my way and throw it in my book bag and then get hanging out with my girlfriend a bit. ; Patient: And then maybe on my way back home I'll shoot up the buddy. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So, really, you're running into him as you walk to your girlfriend's house. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, and he's there and the temptation is great. ; Patient: I mean, it's, like, that house is kind of, that's actually where I shoot up a lot. ; Patient: So it's like whenever I'm... ; Patient: I was in his house. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: So it's like whenever I'm coming up to his house, I'm like, I start getting excited, you know, like, I start anticipating how great it's going to feel the next time. ; Patient: And it's, I don't know, it's like stuck with me. ; Patient: I get excited when I see his house. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So you have a feeling. ; Therapist: So, let's explore this. ; Therapist: So as you're walking up to the, well, as you're getting ready to pass his house, like, to point your way to your girlfriend, you divert to kind of go to his house and you have this feeling of excitement. ; Therapist: What's the thought that's going through your mind? ; Patient: I, like, I kind of, I just can't wait for the next hit. ; Patient: Now, like, I've passed his house since my parents had given me the ultimatum. ; Patient: And now it's kind of mixed because I'm like, oh, man, if I get to do that and somehow they find out, like, it's kind of all over for me. ; Patient: And then, but on the other hand, I'm thinking about how great it's going to be. ; Patient: I'm just kind of like, I'm playing in my mind how much I'm going to do and like, what kind of plans we'll have for the rest of the night. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you have a few things going on. ; Therapist: Do you think, like, is your plan right now to go into the detox? ; Patient: It is, yeah. ; Patient: It's, yeah, I mean, my definite plan is to go into the detox. ; Patient: And if the detox works, like, I mean, I think I could be done with it. ; Patient: But it's just, I don't know if the detox can work. ; Patient: And I mean, I've never, I only tried to cut back that one time. ; Patient: I mean, I don't know how good I'll be at it, you know. ; Therapist: Let's presume for a second that the detox would be successful and you wouldn't be, well, you mean you wouldn't be on heroin coming out of detox, right? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Are you worried at that point that you'll go right back? ; Patient: I don't know if I'll go right back. ; Patient: Like, I think if I can get off it, if the detox actually works, like they say I do, I think I can stay off it. ; Patient: I think, like, my, I think my cravings will still always be there. ; Patient: But now that it's, like, now that I've come to the realization that some of the stuff that I can lose if I get caught, I mean, if I can get off it for good, I don't, I don't think I'd go back. ; Patient: It might be hard, like, if I run into my buddy or something. ; Therapist: That's the point of worry, right? ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So there is a concern that you'll, you could, you could go back if you run into him. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But if you could stay away from him, you think you'd increase your chances of being successful? ; Patient: Well, I mean, yeah, definitely. ; Patient: I won't, like, there's, there's so many, like, experiences in this house that, that kind of feed into the anticipation and the cravings. ; Patient: So, I mean, if that doesn't happen, you know, it'll probably help. ; Therapist: When are your plans in terms of going into detox? ; Patient: Pretty soon. ; Patient: I think I'm supposed to go on Monday after the weekend. ; Patient: So, like, three days. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it, it, it actually sounds like what your parents have put in place, you believe will work, right? ; Therapist: You have confidence it'll work. ; Therapist: And that your, your worry is, what worry you have is when you get out, can you avoid, can you avoid your friend? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: You don't buy from anybody else other than your friend? ; Patient: No, no, no. ; Therapist: So, so that's really becomes the, you know, maybe one of your key goals here since, since you're kind of, sound like you're committed to the detox part. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: I mean, unless I'm, I'm reading that incorrectly, that, that seems to be something you're- ; Patient: No, yeah, if it works, I mean, I can try. ; Therapist: So it's, it's preparing for life after detox. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And avoiding, well, you've heard the phrase, people, places, things, with the, you know, addictions or, or substance use. ; Therapist: So in this case, you need to avoid, it would seem, your friend. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And, and where he lives. ; Therapist: Right, which is unfortunately not far from you and in between, like his house is in between your house and your girlfriend's. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Right, so, is there a way, this may seem a little odd, but is there a way to walk around the block where you can completely avoid his house and still get to your girlfriend's house? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, there is, it's kind of out of the way, but I think, yeah, I could go, there's like a, like a horseshoe path, I could, yeah, I could, I could like go up the block and then like around the horseshoe and then, and then I could like turn right and get to her house there. ; Patient: And then, yeah. ; Therapist: So you would never even see his house. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: How about other options as well, like, so there's that option, how about her coming over to where your parents live, has that ever happened before? ; Patient: I mean, yeah, she's, she's come over, so maybe if like, maybe if I tell her that it'll, it'll help me out, she can, like she can make that walk and it'll be, like it'll be easier. ; Therapist: Because she can walk right by that house without a problem. ; Patient: Right, right, and I mean, if I start walking out of the house, it'll be harder for me to actually do what I'm supposed to, so if I like can't even leave and she comes, that might be best. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And to get to work, do you have to pass his house? ; Patient: No, not at all. ; Patient: I, like I work down the road, so I just drive, like I drive the other way out the, out the community. ; Therapist: Right, so there's kind of some, like really there's a physical kind of slash behavioral strategy here, which is just physically keeping you away. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: From having to go buy his house and it sounds like the only reason other than to, to buy and use drugs is to see your girlfriend. ; Patient: Right, yeah. ; Therapist: And there's an alternative strategy here, right? ; Therapist: She, she can come to you or you could go all the way, all the way around and then all the way around back. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: To return it and to get back and forth to work, you don't have to go buy his house at all. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, I could do that actually. ; Patient: I don't know where. ; Therapist: Is there ever a time where he comes to you? ; Patient: Honestly, not that much. ; Patient: Now, he, obviously he doesn't, he doesn't really like to leave his house much. ; Patient: He's, he's kind of the only one who lives there. ; Patient: So that's kind of, he just deals out of there and then shoots up there, so he, he stays in his house most of the time, so now he doesn't even come out. ; Therapist: And we, you know, we, we know that there's automatic thoughts, we talked about this before, right? ; Therapist: There's automatic thoughts that lead to feelings and behaviors. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: And can you identify a specific thought that may occur or maybe has occurred not related to walking by his house but when you've been in your house? ; Therapist: Like, that maybe has motivated you to go walk to his house? ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I'm bored. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah, just straight up, I mean when, when there's nothing to do in the house, my parents are gone. ; Patient: So it's a, it's the best way to have fun. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So you've identified a thought that, that directly connects to a behavior you want to avoid, right? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So I'm bored leads to using the drugs, right? ; Therapist: Because that would alleviate the boredom, right? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Is there an adaptive response that you can put in right there that you can interject right at that moment when you say, I'm bored? ; Therapist: Is there an adaptive response you can apply? ; Therapist: Let's assume this is post detox, right? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Okay, that's your plan. ; Therapist: You're sitting in your house, detox is done. ; Therapist: There's no more, you know, we would hope withdrawal type symptoms. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: The thought comes upon you, I'm bored. ; Therapist: What's a, what's a self-talk piece that could be interjected there? ; Patient: I think like if I, if I remember to think what I don't want to do when I think that I'm bored, like I just kind of come up with something else. ; Patient: So like right now my, usually my two choices when I'm bored are either to go to my buddy's house or go to my girl's house who's, you know, across from my buddy's. ; Patient: So maybe that could just be like one of the times where I call my girl and be like, hey, can you just like come over, we can do something. ; Patient: Like just to kind of distract me from, from like wanting to go over to his place, you know. ; Therapist: So, so the, the adaptive response is I'll call my girlfriend. ; Patient: Right, yeah. ; Therapist: So I'm bored and, and she, you know, it sounds like what you said, she's really supportive of you quitting. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean she wasn't too happy with me doing it. ; Patient: She doesn't use, so I mean there's, there's that. ; Patient: So she'll be all, she'll be all on board for that. ; Therapist: It seems like consequences motivate you, right? ; Therapist: I mean that's what brought you in today, like to talk about this anyway. ; Therapist: So I'm wondering if another adaptive response, response couldn't involve, you know, I don't want any, any trouble. ; Therapist: You know, and you can substitute a lot of words in for trouble. ; Therapist: There's all kinds of trouble that can occur from use and error, right? ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So getting kicked out of your house, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to get kicked out of my house. ; Therapist: I'm clean and there's something else I can do here other than drugs, right? ; Therapist: Like I'm thinking in times when your girlfriend might not be around. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right, so you still want to have, you want to have an adaptive response that's not necessarily tied to a person in case she isn't around. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So you can use that one, certainly, and that's a good one. ; Therapist: But when she's not around and you kind of revisit those consequences in your adaptive response, do you think that's going to be enough motivation to keep you from going to the house? ; Patient: Yeah, I do. ; Patient: I mean, I, like as of right now, work's going good, like school is going good. ; Patient: I don't, like I really don't want any problems. ; Patient: And I think like now I'm starting to realize that if I, if I do keep using it's not just going to be something like that I do when I'm bored or like that I'm doing for fun. ; Patient: It's going to turn into like a problem that's going to kind of affect everything else. ; Patient: So I think like if I just remember to tell myself, like when I'm feeling bored, if I just remember to tell myself like I don't, I don't want to be out in the streets and like especially I don't want to lose my job. ; Patient: Like I think telling myself those things, it'll help remind me like kind of what's at stake, you know. ; Therapist: Good, good. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you have some adaptive responses to use. ; Therapist: Another thing that occurs to me is your parents around much? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean they're, my dad works a lot, my mom's usually at home. ; Patient: She works too, it's like a part-time job so she's usually like home at night. ; Therapist: And is it at night one of the times when you have gone over to your friend's house? ; Therapist: Well it's actually, it's more during the day. ; Therapist: More during the day. ; Therapist: So she could be an asset in terms of trying to stop you from leaving the house but only when she's there. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And similar to your father, you know. ; Therapist: So it's really, I guess we kind of narrow it down to when you're at home alone and particularly when your girlfriend's not available, that's your high-risk time. ; Patient: Right, yeah. ; Therapist: So we have the cognitive adaptive responses to come in and play. ; Therapist: But what if there's anything more behavioral we can do like can you go somewhere else? ; Patient: Well I think like one of the other things I do to kind of clear my head is I always go for a drive. ; Patient: So like if I start feeling bored, I think maybe if I like get in my car and like I sat on the bus past his house, if I just drive away, like just physically leave the temptation. ; Patient: And then like from there I can go to a bookstore or like a comic book store. ; Patient: I could spend hours in there. ; Patient: So maybe if I can like, I can remind myself to drive away, go to those stores and like maybe I can just kind of stay out there late enough until either like my girlfriend's home or my parents come home. ; Therapist: I think that's a good plan. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And remember that the more we apply these adaptive responses, right, what we hope is that you, the risk decreases, like your craving decreases, your motivation to stay clean increases. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So while it may be a little inconvenient to drive someplace every time no one's available and you get that thought, that might not be something you have to do forever. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But that'll minimize the risk for now and we want to focus on the short term first and then we'll worry more about the mid-term and long-term. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Circumstances may change. ; Therapist: Maybe people reside there forever. ; Therapist: Maybe somebody's work schedule will change. ; Therapist: Maybe there are other adaptations you can make. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But for now, I think this would be a good way to go, just keeping you away from the circumstance that you definitely don't want. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So good. ; Therapist: There's a few behavioral pieces we have in here and then a few cognitive as well. ; Therapist: So I want to see you in a couple of days before we go into detox so that we can practice some of these adaptive responses. ; Therapist: I'd like you to practice them at home between now and then as well. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: And these behavioral responses as well. ; Therapist: But we'll try to get them shored up right before detox and I'll see it right after you come out as well. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we'll make sure that we just keep working on applying and refining these adaptive cognitive responses and these adaptive behavioral responses. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Does that sound like a plan? ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Patient: I think that will definitely help, especially being with your adaptive detox. ; Patient: That will definitely be the best. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: I appreciate you coming in, Jesse, and I'll see you in a couple of days. ; Patient: Yeah, thank you. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi cinderella. well we have about half an hour together this time And how are you feeling right now? ; Therapist: What's your awareness? ; Therapist: Is a bit of a kind of situation different from last time? ; Patient: No, I'm still feeling the same. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Just, yeah. ; Therapist: You said you were going to watch. ; Patient: Just a little frustrated at the moment, that's all. ; Therapist: What is the frustration like for you? ; Patient: It's just a tight feeling that I have. ; Patient: I just, yeah, it's very, it's difficult to put into words, but just, it just doesn't feel good. ; Therapist: So, let's shift it to your body. ; Therapist: Where in your body do you feel this tight feeling? ; Patient: I think it's in my chest. ; Therapist: So that's the heart area. ; Therapist: It's the feeling around the heart. ; Therapist: Yeah, right. ; Therapist: And what is there in that heart when you pay attention to that area in your heart? ; Therapist: What do you find there? ; Therapist: What sort of thing do you find there? ; Patient: Yes, it's just a really, just a compressing feeling. ; Therapist: I noticed that you have been saying it when you talked about your feelings. ; Therapist: And I would like to suggest if you can say I instead of it and see what happens in your body. ; Therapist: So go ahead. ; Patient: You actually want me to say? ; Therapist: Yes, yes, yes. ; Patient: My chest feels very tired. ; Patient: I feel very frustrated, angry. ; Therapist: Angry. ; Therapist: So that's what's coming out, frustration, anger. ; Therapist: So what are you doing in this moment with your anger as you are sensing it right here in your chest? ; Therapist: In this moment? ; Patient: I'm just accepting it. ; Patient: It's just there. ; Therapist: So you're accepting it. ; Therapist: And once you accept that anger inside you, what else do you do with that anger, having accepted it? ; Patient: It's just a part of me. ; Therapist: You notice you are saying it again? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: I am angry. ; Therapist: Use the word I. ; Therapist: I. ; Therapist: It's a thing to acknowledge this is you, not something out there. ; Therapist: You do it a lot. ; Therapist: And you think it's something very strong, you put it out there. ; Therapist: So it's a safe way to put it. ; Therapist: If you say I feel angry. ; Patient: I feel angry. ; Therapist: And who do you feel angry at? ; Patient: My ex-husband, yes. ; Therapist: Your ex-husband. ; Therapist: Sandra, having just explored some of your feelings around the situation you have, I'm going to suggest that you speak to Jeff on an empty chair. ; Therapist: This may be a little uncomfortable, but it helped me to facilitate a process where I become an observer and you'll be dialoguing with the party that you are actually having to deal with. ; Therapist: And I'll be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the things that we could do to change the process. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Let's bring Jeff, in your imagination, that you ask if Jeff were here. ; Therapist: I'll bring a chair. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Welcome, Jeff. ; Therapist: I mean, I welcome Jeff. ; Therapist: You don't have to. ; Therapist: And there's Jeff. ; Therapist: So imagine his face, how he looks like, how you remember him now. ; Therapist: And bring him in in your fantasy. ; Therapist: And then when you're ready, just say whatever comes to you at that moment, this moment spontaneously. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Jeff, I feel very frustrated about the situation that you have left me and the children in. ; Patient: I don't think you understand how hard it is at times and the things that I have to explain to them about this situation. ; Patient: It bothers me that you don't go out of your way to spend extra time with the children. ; Patient: And I really believe that in the future they will come to really resent that and not look at you as their father. ; Patient: I honestly can't understand why you don't want to spend more time with them. ; Patient: And irrespective of what's happened between us and you moving on and so forth, I just don't think that your children and my children should really suffer in that way. ; Patient: I would like them to have as normal a life as possible and be able to be with both of their parents. ; Patient: And what is so important rather than them wanting to be with them. ; Patient: It's just very hard. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So there's a kind of question. ; Therapist: You understand why this happened, et cetera, right? ; Therapist: So what next thing we'll do, you'll sit over there and you will be Jeff and see what Jeff can answer to you as to where he is at. ; Therapist: That may be a little bit difficult, but let's do a dialogue. ; Therapist: I see if he were here. ; Therapist: He's not here anyway. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So we'll be having a dialogue between Jeff, the imaginary Jeff that you have, and you in the present here and now. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Patient: And what is he saying? ; Therapist: Well, go ahead. ; Therapist: I'm going to suggest instead of over there. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: The moment you sit over there, you become Jeff. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And whatever Jeff says to the statement that you made, go ahead, Jeff. ; Patient: Sandra, I know that it must have been hard on you and the kids with me leaving. ; Patient: And it's not that I don't want to spend more time with them, but I am very busy with work and a few other things that are going on in my life. ; Patient: Sandra, my children do mean a lot to me. ; Patient: And if I was to spend more time with them, though, when I contact you about it, I don't want you to be short and rude. ; Patient: And I want you to be open to the opportunity. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I'll stop you, Jeff, and say, Sandra, the children really mean a lot to me. ; Therapist: Just say that to her again, the statement. ; Patient: Sandra, the children really do mean a lot to me. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So go back to there. ; Therapist: So check your frustration over there. ; Therapist: How do you feel different about him now that he really cares for the children? ; Therapist: And there is a future maybe with him and them? ; Therapist: Do you feel that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So have you any appreciations to Jeff? ; Therapist: I know there are the hurts and frustration and anger, but any appreciation that he still cares for these children as a father? ; Patient: I really don't have any appreciation for that because the reason that you've given, that you're busy, like I'm busy in my life and I still give our children priority, they still take precedence in my life. ; Patient: And I just don't think that that's right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And your father, he should be. ; Therapist: To the children. ; Patient: You should be proactive in wanting to see them. ; Patient: And I wouldn't mind if you wanted to see them more than what we have agreed. ; Patient: If there are times when you want to do something spontaneous and see them, then feel free to contact us and see if it's okay. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Come over there. ; Therapist: You sound like a very good idea. ; Therapist: Good offer. ; Therapist: Is it, Jeff, are you prepared to take that offer off for the kids' sake? ; Patient: Well, Sandra, I'm glad that you said that. ; Patient: And I think that's something. ; Patient: That's something that I could look at. ; Patient: But when I contact you, I don't want you to be to be short with me or rude. ; Patient: I want you to consider it and and to be honest. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Go over there. ; Therapist: So you're aware what's going on here? ; Therapist: The contract's happening. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You're aware that it seems the two parties seem to be agreeing, beginning to agree to something important. ; Therapist: And that's the children. ; Therapist: So the children will not suffer. ; Therapist: They will actually benefit from that agreement if you two can really, really come to a mutual agreement to what, how are we going to take care of the children? ; Therapist: Because this thing, no matter how, in my view, no matter how people live together as a couple, separate together, the contract, life contract is I'm still my father to my children, you're still my mother to my children. ; Therapist: We could only get that anger out, frustration out. ; Therapist: We can come to an agreement as to how we're going to work together. ; Therapist: Even if we may not live together, we will live with the kids and they'll be happy. ; Therapist: Does that make sense to you? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: There's a but. ; Patient: But how do I? ; Patient: It's a question. ; Therapist: Good, good, good. ; Patient: This is in a counseling session and he hasn't really participated in informing this contract. ; Therapist: Yes, but you hear that this happened for you? ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: And you've done it. ; Therapist: So is there something that now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him, no matter how he is? ; Therapist: Because there's now a new realization that the children need that father and mother. ; Therapist: How's that for you? ; Patient: Yes, maybe I just need to let him know that and just extend the invitation of having more ; Patient: time. ; Therapist: Without that. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Remember? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And you're good at that. ; Therapist: You're very good. ; Therapist: Watching you working here, you're very good at creating contracts and very clear about what you want. ; Therapist: It's a question of how you can, the two parties can get to that agreement together. ; Therapist: What do you think? ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Because this is a rehearsal for what's going to happen. ; Patient: Okay.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Andrea, thanks for coming in. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: So I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here, so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself, basically. ; Therapist: My job is to meet with all of the students. ; Therapist: I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do. ; Therapist: It's not my job to change you. ; Therapist: I couldn't even if I wanted to. ; Therapist: That's not my role at all. ; Therapist: It's really to help you think about how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward. ; Therapist: Does that sound okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right, so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself. ; Patient: Sure. ; Patient: As you know, I'm Andrea. ; Patient: I'm a junior. ; Patient: I'm in the marching band. ; Patient: I play the center sax. ; Therapist: Oh, neat. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm also in the, I'm a little bit of a band geek. ; Patient: I play, you know, the wind ensemble and the jazz band, things like that. ; Therapist: Wow, you really are involved in music. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: When did you start? ; Patient: I started playing about ten years ago, actually. ; Therapist: Wow. ; Patient: Yeah, I started on the violin first, and then I went on, explored a little with the piano, clarinet, finally found the tenor sax. ; Therapist: Very cool. ; Therapist: I've always wanted to be good at music. ; Therapist: All right, so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles. ; Therapist: Any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun? ; Patient: You know, just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach, things like that. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Just kind of everyday sort of stuff. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Tell me a little bit about your family. ; Patient: Well, I have one older brother. ; Patient: He's about eight and a half years older than me, my parents, and I have a dog. ; Therapist: Cute. ; Therapist: What kind of dog? ; Patient: He's a golden retriever. ; Therapist: Oh, nice. ; Patient: My big boy. ; Therapist: Very fun. ; Therapist: All right, and how are things going in school for you? ; Patient: Pretty good. ; Patient: Grades have been pretty all right. ; Patient: Still like 3.7-ish. ; Therapist: Okay, great. ; Therapist: So you're doing well. ; Therapist: What sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school? ; Patient: I'd like to, you know, I'd like to, of course, graduate high school, hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school. ; Therapist: Oh, all right. ; Patient: I mean, that might not happen, and then I'd like to go on and become a doctor, study psychology, maybe become a psychiatrist or something. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You have some pretty big dreams. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's great. ; Therapist: That's really exciting to think about that and sort of be looking forward to the future and those things. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life, whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that. ; Therapist: So here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people, like belonging or sense of community, again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. ; Therapist: So when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life? ; Patient: I think a sense of community and belonging. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I think those two and respect. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three? ; Patient: Yeah, well, I think community and belonging, I kind of related them. ; Patient: You know how I said I was in the marching band. ; Patient: I really, you know, I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working together towards that one goal. ; Patient: And then in terms of respect, I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules. ; Patient: Like I really do think respect is important to respect myself and respect those around me. ; Patient: So I place great importance in that. ; Therapist: Okay, great. ; Therapist: So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging, like you said, and sort of a sense of purpose in a way. ; Therapist: And then the respect is really sort of all encompassing, not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. ; Therapist: Okay, that's great. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends. ; Therapist: So what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends? ; Patient: Sometimes we just, you know, go to the movies, go to the beach, like I had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house, play some board games and hang out. ; Therapist: And when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved? ; Patient: Yeah, sometimes. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene? ; Patient: Well, it's mostly just for parties or party settings. ; Patient: It's kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up, as they say. ; Therapist: And so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And how often do you think you would say you're drinking? ; Patient: I'd say on a not busy month, for instance. ; Patient: I'd say about like two weekends out of the month, two or three. ; Therapist: So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. ; Therapist: Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink? ; Patient: The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're parties. ; Patient: So it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun. ; Patient: And then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed. ; Patient: It's a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching a movie. ; Patient: It's not, yeah. ; Therapist: So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is going to be there. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at, say, a party versus the night you're playing board games? ; Patient: I think of them as different. ; Patient: I think, you know, like in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing. ; Patient: So it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic. ; Patient: After it all it's very draining. ; Patient: But in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have fun. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol? ; Patient: It's, you know, when we drink we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. ; Patient: We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed. ; Patient: And not really thinking about stresses or things like that. ; Patient: But it can be, when it's too much drinking, it can be obviously bad. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So sort of in the too much drinking or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol? ; Patient: A lot of times it will make people stupid. ; Patient: Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that. ; Patient: We usually try to be as safe about it as possible. ; Patient: So we'll like sleep over a friend's house and so that we're not driving. ; Patient: And it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks. ; Patient: But definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're drunk can be really stupid. ; Therapist: So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities. ; Therapist: You're trying to stay put. ; Therapist: You're not driving. ; Therapist: You're trying to stay with people that you trust. ; Therapist: But yeah, it sounds like there's still some things happening from time to time. ; Patient: Sometimes, yeah. ; Therapist: Can you tell me a little bit about that? ; Patient: Well, I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and we end up like throwing up or things like that. ; Patient: That, I don't, that's not fun. ; Therapist: Yeah, throwing up is never fun. ; Patient: It's not. ; Therapist: And how often do you think that happens? ; Patient: For me, that's happened to me once. ; Patient: It was the first time I ever drank and it was a lot. ; Patient: I didn't know what I was doing. ; Patient: I was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything anyone gave me. ; Patient: That didn't end well. ; Patient: But after that, I haven't, but I do have friends that still do sometimes, so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something. ; Patient: It kind of puts it down around my fun. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sort of carefree, can kind of let loose a little bit more. ; Therapist: But on the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess, planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. ; Therapist: And then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck, your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drank too much. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Any other not so good things about the alcohol? ; Patient: Yeah, people can get a little sloppy, I guess. ; Patient: They're all loose with people in corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff. ; Therapist: So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Got it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. ; Therapist: Why did you make those decisions? ; Patient: I just, I have an aunt who is an alcoholic, so I see the issues that are involved in movies and things. ; Patient: I know that junk driving is an issue. ; Patient: So I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where we can let loose but still be safe, like at someone's house or someone's parent's home or something. ; Patient: So I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: It sounds kind of similar to your value of respect too. ; Therapist: So on the one hand, the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start. ; Therapist: If there's too much, then it sort ofcourse. ; Patient: Then it kind of defeats the purpose. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines. ; Therapist: How do you think that the drinking fits in with that? ; Patient: In terms of what? ; Patient: In terms of respect? ; Patient: I think, well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things, I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And then, but in terms of ways I am respecting myself, I am respecting myself by trying to stay in someone's house and trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out, throwing up and everything. ; Patient: And try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met into I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you're sort of looking for that balance of how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but not crossover. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what have you come up with at this point? ; Therapist: Do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or are you? ; Patient: I usually, well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink. ; Patient: So I'll usually just, you know, get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like alright this is my one drink and I'm good. ; Patient: And that way I still have something in my cup so people aren't going to be like oh here I have some more. ; Patient: I'll be like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be, you know, having some to like let loose a little. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or what do you think? ; Patient: For the most part it works pretty well because like I said people, you know, if people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have, you know, I still have some like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything. ; Patient: But sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start, you know, falling into the too much. ; Therapist: So a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you'd like to make some adjustments to make it a little smoother. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself? ; Patient: I'd like to make sure that I, you know, in terms of respecting myself and my body I'd like to, you know, try to drink less. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Like I, you know, it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so, you know, I'm not damaging my body and I'm like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22. ; Patient: And, you know, have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group, as a community. ; Therapist: Uh huh. ; Therapist: So kind of combining those goals. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking. ; Therapist: How important is it to you to work on that goal on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing right now? ; Patient: I'd say about like a six or a seven. ; Therapist: Oh okay. ; Patient: I'd like to work on it but, you know, if I get around to it I get around to it. ; Patient: If I don't I don't. ; Therapist: Uh huh. ; Therapist: Well why'd you say six or seven rather than like a four? ; Patient: Because I still think it's important. ; Therapist: Uh huh. ; Patient: I still, you know, like I said I don't want my body to, especially going to med school, like I know how things affect your body and also affect your social and your school work and things like that. ; Patient: I know that once I get to college it's not, it's not gonna work out, you know, drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam. ; Patient: I know that's not feasible. ; Patient: It's not a good idea. ; Therapist: Yeah, looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to? ; Patient: I think. ; Therapist: On that same scale from one to ten. ; Patient: I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten. ; Patient: I know I'd be really sure. ; Therapist: Oh wow. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Why'd you say ten? ; Patient: It's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can do it. ; Therapist: Uh huh. ; Patient: It's making the decision in the first place. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Whether. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And so you mentioned, you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. ; Therapist: Have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that? ; Patient: Um, I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding, you know, dorky or something. ; Patient: Be like, hey, you know, let's just stay in today. ; Patient: Like let's not go out or something. ; Patient: Or just be like, hey, I'm not, like, I'm not going to drink today. ; Patient: And even if my friends do, like being okay with them drinking around me and not doing it and then them being okay with me drinking, me not drinking and them doing whatever they want. ; Therapist: So sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or? ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: I think it's very feasible. ; Patient: I think it's possible. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Um, so I guess we'll talk about, um, less alcohol activities. ; Therapist: I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe, um, reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Um, so that's, that goal sounds feasible. ; Therapist: You said, would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going? ; Patient: I think so. ; Patient: I think that's good. ; Therapist: Does that sound like something you'd like to do? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me. ; Therapist: You know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some, some other form of physician. ; Therapist: Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there. ; Therapist: And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol. ; Therapist: And that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of, of, um, drinking too much. ; Therapist: Um, so yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going. ; Patient: Yeah, I'd like to. ; Therapist: All right, great. ; Therapist: So I'll, I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks. ; Patient: Perfect. ; Therapist: Thanks. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: This time, the counselor began by setting the agenda and emphasizing the student's autonomy right away. ; Therapist: She used open questions and reflections to build rapport, then turned to a focus on Andrea's values in order to deepen the connection. ; Therapist: This led easily into a discussion of Andrea's social life and an open question about the role that alcohol plays in it. ; Therapist: Skillful use of reflections guided the conversation while encouraging the student to open up to the counselor. ; Therapist: By using a decisional balance, the counselor was able to assess barriers to change as well as to elicit reasons for change and opportunities to affirm Andrea's good decisions. ; Therapist: She was then able to ask Andrea to expand on her reasons for setting limits with her drinking, which highlighted some of the consequences of alcohol use without using lectures or scolding the student. ; Therapist: The counselor also tied the drinking behavior to Andrea's values, helping to develop a discrepancy between her personal goals and actions. ; Therapist: This set the stage for clarification of goals and beginning discussion of a change plan. ; Therapist: However, the counselor encouraged the student to choose her own behavior or change goal in order to ensure it was something Andrea felt confident she could achieve. ; Therapist: She ended the session with a summary of their discussion, expressed appreciation for Andrea's participation, and communicated optimism about the plan and her desire to continue working with her in the future. ; Therapist: .",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, Lisa. ; Therapist: How you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing okay. ; Therapist: You're doing okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I understand you're here to receive counseling services. ; Patient: My boss sent me here. ; Therapist: Your boss sent you here? ; Therapist: What's going on with you and your boss? ; Patient: It's not even between me and my boss. ; Patient: I'm a good worker at my job. ; Patient: I get everything done on time, but they're calling me inflexible and a perfectionist. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So who's calling you inflexible and a perfectionist? ; Patient: Well, my boss has called me that. ; Patient: I've had several coworkers. ; Patient: There was a recent incident where somebody wanted to change days with me, but I told them the schedule's out. ; Patient: I'm supposed to be here on Wednesday. ; Patient: You can't change it. ; Patient: It's right there. ; Patient: Black and white. ; Patient: I work Wednesday. ; Patient: You can't change that. ; Therapist: And they felt that it would have been more reasonable to change? ; Patient: Well, they wanted to change, and I really don't agree with that. ; Patient: If they needed a certain day off, they need to go through the order of command and ask for a day off. ; Therapist: And they didn't do that and said they asked you to switch days. ; Patient: And then they called me inflexible because I got upset about it. ; Therapist: In what way did you get upset? ; Patient: Well, I told them. ; Patient: I said that's irresponsible, that they didn't think ahead, that they wanted to change with me. ; Patient: I am there at a certain time. ; Patient: I am there from 8 in the morning till 5 in the afternoon. ; Patient: I take my lunch at 12 o'clock. ; Patient: That is my Wednesday. ; Patient: That's always been my Wednesday. ; Patient: I don't know why they want to upset that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So that upset you and that upset them, that whole incident? ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: Anything else that your boss may have as a reason for...? ; Patient: They call me a perfectionist because I like the things done by the book, which I think makes me a great worker. ; Patient: Because I get everything done on deadlines. ; Patient: Not before, not after. ; Patient: Right on the deadline. ; Patient: And everything is just exactly, you know, everything's filed, everything's organized. ; Patient: And some people like to, you know, take a file, oh, well, I need this to fill out a report. ; Patient: No, no, no. ; Patient: It's there. ; Patient: It's in the file. ; Patient: You can't touch it, you can't move it. ; Patient: That's where it needs to be. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you consider yourself fairly well organized as an employee? ; Patient: Oh, absolutely. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Therapist: And you mentioned you're there from 8 to 5. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You take your lunch from 12 to 1230? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: How many days in the last, say, three months have you been late, left early? ; Patient: Oh, zero. ; Therapist: Zero? ; Patient: Zero. ; Patient: No, I'm there 8 to 5. ; Patient: 8 o'clock in the morning to 5. ; Patient: I wake up at 6. ; Patient: I get ready. ; Patient: I leave for work at 7. ; Patient: I get there at 8. ; Patient: The whole day has a schedule. ; Patient: And I meet that schedule. ; Patient: And it's the best thing for me. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So this is frustrating for you that your coworkers can't understand where you're coming from? ; Patient: I just don't get it. ; Patient: You know, I'm doing everything by the book, by the rules. ; Patient: And I'm in trouble somehow? ; Patient: Something's wrong with me because I do it right. ; Patient: I do it the right way and that's wrong somehow. ; Patient: And I don't get it. ; Therapist: Have you ever had to work in a group, like a team with any of your coworkers? ; Patient: They've made me. ; Patient: But I don't like it. ; Therapist: Tell me. ; Patient: Because I know the way we need to do things. ; Patient: If we're given a project, okay. ; Patient: It starts with A, B, C, D, and then no. ; Patient: Everybody wants, oh, let's do C, O, D, and then F. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No, no, no. ; Patient: A, B, C, D. There is no deviation from that. ; Patient: And then they get mad at me. ; Therapist: So working in groups hasn't worked out too well for you? ; Patient: Not really. ; Patient: Not unless people listen to me. ; Therapist: So in instances where people listen to you, how have things worked out? ; Patient: If I oversee everything, I still get uncomfortable because they're out of my sight. ; Patient: I don't know what they're doing sometimes. ; Patient: I have to watch one person, other person's over there. ; Patient: I don't know what they're doing. ; Patient: And if it's not done right, it's not done right. ; Patient: And that's bad. ; Therapist: Can you tell me anything about your mood in general in terms of have you felt sad or anxious? ; Therapist: Anything like that recently? ; Patient: Not particularly. ; Patient: I guess I feel anxious sometimes when things aren't going the way they need to go. ; Patient: Because then it puts off the whole day. ; Patient: And I guess I would consider that anxiety. ; Patient: Because if it's not going the right way, one thing goes wrong, the whole day is thrown off. ; Patient: And then now I have to deal with that. ; Patient: Now I have to adjust my whole schedule, even by a minute. ; Patient: And that does cause me anxiety. ; Therapist: Even by a minute? ; Patient: Even by a minute. ; Therapist: So if your day is not going the way you planned it for it to go, you're feeling some anxiety from that? ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Therapist: Does your employer ever have unscheduled meetings or anything like that that happens? ; Patient: He does. ; Patient: He will schedule some unscheduled meetings. ; Patient: And I've calmly, I've tried to calmly approach him and say, you know, there's a meeting, we need to know about it. ; Patient: I need to schedule my day around the meeting. ; Patient: He once scheduled a meeting at 12.20 and I told him, I'm at lunch 12 to 12.30. ; Patient: Why do you think that's appropriate? ; Patient: I mean, sometimes I feel like I'm the only smart person there. ; Patient: I'm the only person who knows how this needs to run. ; Therapist: Alright, so you have some different stressors at work. ; Therapist: And some disagreements with your co-workers. ; Therapist: Can you tell me anything about your home life? ; Patient: I personally consider my home life very neat. ; Patient: You know, if you go into my home, everything's nice. ; Patient: Everything's where it needs to be. ; Patient: I have my meals scheduled out. ; Patient: I have a nice little calendar. ; Patient: Everything's planned. ; Patient: Thursday's chicken, Fridays, tamales, and so on and so forth. ; Therapist: So your home life's a bit like your work life in terms of being organized. ; Patient: That's the right way to do it. ; Therapist: Do you ever, in terms of your home life, do you ever collect anything? ; Patient: Yeah, I do. ; Therapist: Tell me about that. ; Patient: I guess that does also cause me some anxiety because I do like to collect things. ; Patient: If I have a good day, I like to keep the newspaper on the day that I had a good day. ; Patient: And I have newspapers from years ago. ; Patient: With no important news on them. ; Patient: But I just can't seem to let it go. ; Therapist: So you keep them in your home? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So newspapers, anything else that you collect? ; Patient: Receipts. ; Therapist: Receipts? ; Patient: Well, it says to keep, I mean, I've always known you have to keep receipts. ; Patient: You don't know when you're ever going to have to prove that you purchased something or when you have to return something. ; Therapist: So what percentage of the receipts that you're given do you think that you keep? ; Patient: All of them. ; Therapist: All of them? ; Patient: Every single one. ; Patient: I get very upset if I go to McDonald's or Food Fast Food Place, I want my receipt. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: I'm going to ask you some questions. ; Therapist: We'll go back to work, kind of regarding your work schedule. ; Therapist: Do you wash your hands regularly at work? ; Patient: I wash my hands before I eat. ; Patient: After I eat. ; Patient: After I use the restroom for 30 seconds. ; Patient: Every time. ; Therapist: Do you ever find yourself like having washed your hands and then going back and washing them several other times? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: There's no need to do that. ; Therapist: No need to do that? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: You wash your hands 30 seconds. ; Patient: That's it. ; Patient: That's all you need to do. ; Therapist: Do you have any particular concerns about germs or anything like that? ; Patient: I try to keep neat, but not particularly, no. ; Therapist: Have you ever found yourself in a situation where touching something repeatedly like a doorknob or operating a light switch seems to lower your anxiety, like repeatedly doing that? ; Patient: Not at all. ; Patient: That seems like a waste of time. ; Therapist: That would be inefficient? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: There's no need to do that. ; Therapist: How about double checking, for example, light switches to make sure the doors are locked? ; Patient: I make sure my doors are locked the first time. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you check, but just the one time? ; Patient: Well, I do it when I come in the door. ; Patient: Lock the door. ; Patient: That's it. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what do you think the solution here is? ; Therapist: Your employer sends you in for counseling. ; Therapist: What would you like to change? ; Patient: He wants me to be more flexible. ; Patient: To not get as upset if there is an unscheduled meeting. ; Patient: If somebody wants to switch shifts with me. ; Patient: I don't really understand it, but I'm in trouble at work, so I have to look into it. ; Therapist: You like your job? ; Patient: I do like my job. ; Patient: I like being able to have everything I need. ; Patient: If somebody calls for something, you know, oh, it's right here. ; Patient: If somebody calls for something, oh, it's right here. ; Patient: I love it. ; Patient: It's like a machine. ; Therapist: So you like your job. ; Therapist: You like how you're able to be organized there. ; Therapist: But there's some conflict with coworkers and your boss. ; Therapist: You want to try to work that out. ; Patient: I guess. ; Patient: I mean, I don't want to lose my job. ; Patient: And if this is a problem, the right thing to do would be to come speak to you. ; Therapist: Alright, so you're open to attending counseling sessions and taking a look at what's going on here? ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Patient: If my boss requires it, if my boss requires it, then that's the right thing to do. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: I want to appreciate you answering my questions. ; Therapist: It's been very helpful. ; Therapist: We'll get you on the schedule to see a counselor here. ; Therapist: It might take about a week. ; Therapist: And we'll go from there. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: See you in a week. ; Patient: Alright, thank you. ; Patient: Thanks.",

; Therapist: He told me about that. ; Patient: Well, yeah, I mean I had called, I've called the police a few times because there's something going on in my neighborhood. ; Patient: And it makes me seem like I'm depressed, but I'm not. ; Patient: I just, I'm concerned about what's going on. ; Therapist: So you're not depressed, you're more concerned. ; Therapist: So what's going on where you live that's leading to these feelings? ; Patient: Well, it's actually very scary. ; Patient: There, I know about the government has been kidnapping girls in this area and taking them away for sex trafficking and prostitution. ; Therapist: So you believe the government is apprehending people in the area where you live? ; Patient: I know they are. ; Therapist: You know they are? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And did you see things that specifically led you to believe this? ; Patient: Yeah, yes. ; Patient: So there specifically were two girls that lived down the street and I saw a van come down the street and the girls were taken and that's when I initially called the police, but I found that they're in on it too. ; Patient: They... ; Therapist: The police are in on it too? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: They tried to tell me that the girls are just, were, they're safe and with their aunt, but ; Patient: I know they're not. ; Therapist: So they investigated what you saw and they came back and told you that... ; Patient: They pretended to. ; Therapist: They pretended to investigate? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And they came back and told you everything was okay, but you're not... ; Patient: I mean I know it's a lie because I saw the girls, I haven't seen the girls since. ; Patient: I saw the girls on the street, the van came, the girls were not there and they told me everything's fine, but I know that's a lie and I won't go back to the police again because I know that they're now in on it. ; Therapist: They're in on the... ; Patient: What the government's been doing. ; Therapist: What the government's been doing. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: What do you think of your father's concerns with, you know, he's concerned that you're, that you're down, you're depressed and that your thinking hasn't been, been clear? ; Therapist: What do you think about his concerns? ; Patient: I mean, I know he's worried about me, but you know, it's... ; Patient: He just doesn't understand the severity of the situation and you know, it's hard, it's hard to sleep when I'm thinking about these poor girls and you know, it's the government. ; Patient: Like the government has cameras everywhere and they can watch what I'm doing at all times and it's, you know, it's exhausting. ; Patient: So I can see how he would think I'm depressed because you know, I'm worried, I'm not sleeping well and I'm not eating because what if they poisoned my food? ; Patient: You know, they're poisoning water all the time. ; Patient: So you know, it is, it's scary and it is affecting you, but it's not depression. ; Therapist: You're not, you're not depressed? ; Patient: No, I'm sad for those girls and I'm scared for, for me and like what's going on. ; Patient: But you know, I want to make sure that this doesn't happen again because you know, I can't let it happen. ; Patient: I can't let this continue. ; Patient: So that's, that's what's taking up my time right now. ; Therapist: And how long has this been going on? ; Patient: Um, for a few months. ; Therapist: A few months. ; Therapist: Is that when you first saw what you, what you believe to be the kidnapping? ; Patient: When I saw the kidnapping, yes. ; Therapist: That was a few months ago. ; Therapist: Were there any beliefs like this before two months? ; Patient: Um, I mean, yes. ; Patient: I've always been aware that the government, you know, is probably up to things that they probably shouldn't be and that they have access and abilities beyond, you know, the normal person. ; Patient: But after I saw the kidnapping, um, I had proof and so it's, it's gotten worse because I feel like they know that I know. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you, you felt this way for a while, but seeing what you saw two months ago, that, that made you more sure? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Because now I have proof. ; Therapist: Because now you have proof. ; Therapist: Have you ever been treated for depression in the past? ; Patient: Um, yes. ; Patient: Um, my dad has taken me before when he was worried about me. ; Patient: Um, but I, you know, it's never really been depression. ; Patient: It's always been something else. ; Patient: Like, I'm fine. ; Patient: I just, I'm aware of what's going on around me. ; Patient: And I don't think my dad understands that. ; Patient: I don't think, um, the places he takes me understands that. ; Patient: So. ; Therapist: What have, uh, the people at the places where he has taken you, what have, what have they said about your condition? ; Patient: Um, you know, they, they try to say the same thing that, you know, I'm depressed or, um, whatever. ; Patient: But, you know, I know, I know the truth. ; Patient: And sometimes I just have to play along. ; Therapist: You just play along with it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Because, you know, this is what the government wants. ; Patient: They want me to look crazy. ; Patient: So, there's something I can do about it. ; Therapist: So you think they want to, like, discredit, discredit you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Because if I, if, you know, it's kind of like smearing my good name. ; Patient: They see me, um, in and out of different agencies and appearing crazy, you know, or, obviously, a lot of people don't believe the story. ; Patient: They choose not to believe or they get paid off. ; Patient: And they write what they write on my file, but it's not true. ; Patient: I'm, I just know what's going on. ; Therapist: And because you know what's going on, that's what's led to all, um, these occurrences. ; Therapist: This has led to the symptoms. ; Patient: Yeah, like lately, yeah. ; Patient: Like, you know, I haven't been able to sleep, you know, and, you know, I feel guilty about what's going on around me and that I know and that, you know, I feel it's hard for me to help them, like, with, you know, cameras everywhere. ; Patient: I can't even go to the grocery store without being watched. ; Patient: And I know they're watching me. ; Patient: So, you know, I do everything I'm supposed to, you know, like I go to work, I do the chores because I have to make sure they see me going to work and doing the chores. ; Therapist: So you, so you kind of play along? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So do you ever have any thoughts related to death or dying or anything like that? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No, like I'm worried. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: You're worried about what? ; Patient: I mean, I'm worried about the government, you know, destroying my life, you know, but I don't want to die and I don't think they're going to kill me. ; Patient: I think that would be too easy and it would just be more proof, so. ; Therapist: That would be more proof that what you've seen is real? ; Patient: Correct. ; Patient: Because obviously I'm trying to tell people about it. ; Patient: And if I suddenly show up missing, like, people are going to know. ; Patient: So I know that they're not going to hurt me, but they could make me look crazy and I'm worried about my life, like, they're worrying about my life. ; Therapist: About it in that way. ; Therapist: How about any drug or alcohol abuse or anything like that? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Nothing? ; Patient: I don't like to use those things. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Any medical conditions? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Has there ever been a time when you felt, like, really very happy? ; Therapist: Like, a lot of energy and it was, you were very happy for several days? ; Patient: Not really. ; Therapist: That's never happened? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Have you ever heard or seen things other people can't hear or see? ; Patient: I think that I'm aware of things that people don't know, like. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Have you been hospitalized before? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: But again, it was, I tried to initially tell my dad about some things that I knew about, and he had taken me to the hospital, but that was before. ; Therapist: So I would like to get you in a talk to a counselor today. ; Therapist: How do you feel about that? ; Patient: Is it really necessary today? ; Patient: Like, can I come back another day? ; Therapist: I think it would be helpful if we had a counselor talk to you today. ; Patient: Well, I understand that's what you need to do, so I guess, you know, if that's what we need to do to get this over with, that's fine. ; Therapist: You can be okay with that? ; Patient: I can play along. ; Therapist: You can play along? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Sherry, I want to thank you for answering these questions. ; Therapist: I know this is a tough experience for you, and having a tough time with everything that's going on that you've described. ; Therapist: So it's been helpful for you to answer these questions for me. ; Therapist: And I'll just need a couple minutes, and I'll get you over to see a counselor, and we'll kind of go from there. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Thank you, Sherry. ; Patient: You're welcome.",

; Therapist: What behavior do you think did that? ; Patient: I guess my gambling and my promiscuity, you know, like for instance, well, I mean, this one friend from high school, we were really close and I ended up getting with her boyfriend when they were together. ; Patient: But I mean, you know, people forgive each other, like what's the big deal? ; Patient: She couldn't get over it. ; Patient: And then the other, my other friend got mad at me for that because I slept with her boyfriend, but I was drunk. ; Patient: And I mean, I was gambling that night, so really who cares? ; Patient: But I don't know. ; Patient: And then I would post on Facebook and just constantly post just about different guys or that I was gambling and that I was winning. ; Patient: You know, I didn't think it turned some people off, I guess, but I don't know why it would because it was just having a good time. ; Therapist: And this was all back in high school?

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Good morning Curtis, it's good seeing you again. ; Therapist: Go ahead and have a seat. ; Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing very well. ; Therapist: I'm doing good. ; Therapist: So today's your first visit with me today. ; Therapist: Were you okay with traffic? ; Therapist: Were you able to find the slaves? ; Patient: Yes, I was. ; Patient: I was a little shaky. ; Therapist: Did you find parking okay? ; Patient: I did. ; Therapist: I just wanted to interview you. ; Therapist: I know you had some concerns. ; Therapist: You called me so we're going to go over that today. ; Therapist: What I wanted to do first of all was ask you what brings you here today to my office? ; Patient: I think I need like therapeutic help. ; Therapist: Looking into some therapy classes. ; Therapist: What kind of classes are you looking for? ; Patient: Drug and alcohol perhaps. ; Therapist: Right now today are you using any drugs today? ; Patient: Not as much as I used to honestly. ; Patient: At least I go out and party with my friends and use a lot. ; Patient: Like almost on a daily basis but I do it as much. ; Therapist: What is your number one drug of choice right now? ; Patient: Weed. ; Therapist: You smoke a lot of weed. ; Therapist: Now do you smoke it with friends by yourself? ; Patient: Yes, usually with friends actually. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself doing it at home or do you go out? ; Patient: No, I go out because my mom doesn't allow it. ; Therapist: I usually go out to the park or after school or something like that. ; Therapist: Do you feel that that's something that you need to help you function or is it something that I have? ; Patient: It's a habit and it helps me relax honestly. ; Patient: It keeps me down. ; Therapist: Now do you go smoke weed with other friends or by yourself? ; Patient: I usually go with my other friends because they are my influences to be with. ; Therapist: Right, okay. ; Therapist: So do you feel that it helps you function better or is it just something that you're just experimenting with or what exactly do you? ; Patient: It actually helps me function better, a lot better actually. ; Patient: I know it's not the right choice or anything but it's what I'm kind of getting into therapy. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: I can find out what it's like. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself spending a lot of money on marijuana? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How much do you spend a week or what's your habit like right now? ; Patient: About $100 a week. ; Therapist: $100 a week. ; Therapist: Okay, so that's pretty much equivalent to about maybe $10 to $15 a day. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright, okay. ; Therapist: Alright, well you know what we want to do is just be able to help you maybe create some steps to help you begin to phase out in time. ; Patient: I want to pretty much identify the problem and that's the marijuana. ; Therapist: Would you say that maybe there's events in your life that trigger your use? ; Therapist: Is there something that which I wanted to ask you, what's your family structure like right now? ; Patient: You know what, I get along with my family. ; Patient: I have a foster family because I was born and when I was born it was kind of separated from my biological family so it kind of put me in foster care. ; Patient: I was like that since I was two years old and from two to thirteen I lived with my two other siblings. ; Patient: Yeah, that's funny. ; Therapist: So pretty much you've been raised by your foster parents and your biological parents are not in the picture? ; Patient: No, they're not actually. ; Therapist: Okay, now in your family how many siblings do you have? ; Patient: Six. ; Patient: Oh, I'm raised with two. ; Therapist: And what number are you? ; Patient: I'm actually the oldest. ; Patient: You're the oldest of the six siblings. ; Therapist: So do you feel maybe there was added responsibility put on you? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Did you guys live together or were you all pretty much separated? ; Patient: There was only two of us. ; Patient: One of my sisters and one of the, yeah two of my sisters. ; Patient: We just lived together and I didn't have full responsibility. ; Patient: I was just kind of. ; Therapist: Right, and so your other four siblings where did they go? ; Patient: You know what, I have no problem. ; Therapist: So you've been separated since birth pretty much and you were raised by your foster parents. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how do you feel about that? ; Therapist: I mean how does that make you feel as far as you were raised by your foster parents? ; Patient: I used to get made fun of when I was in school and it was a little bit harder on me but I'm kind of getting over it now. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: I tried to contact them but it's not working out. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So they're pretty much your biological parents are not in your life? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And your foster parents are pretty much the ones that raised you. ; Therapist: Those are your parents? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I would say my mom. ; Therapist: Your mom and dad. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And then also as you were living together at home, how were you disciplined? ; Therapist: Or who were you disciplined by? ; Therapist: Who disciplined? ; Patient: My mom, not so much of my dad. ; Patient: He was kind of laid back, cool, relaxed. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: You know, my mom sure disciplined. ; Patient: It can go from being grounded, from a weapon, you know, from show and take our equipment like PlayStations or phones or. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So that was pretty much a consequence for your behavior. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Patient: For that behavior equal to consequence. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Would you say that mom was consistent? ; Therapist: She pretty much disciplined everybody? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: She disciplined everybody the same. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: So growing up, do you feel the discipline helped you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I do. ; Patient: I live in this whole drug use. ; Patient: Other than that, I think it helped me a lot. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It kind of set some boundaries for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: Does your mother know that you smoke marijuana? ; Patient: She doesn't know that I do it at this exact moment because a while ago I kind of stopped. ; Patient: Didn't I do it as much? ; Patient: I told her that. ; Patient: So she doesn't really know that I'm doing it as much right now. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: The reason why I'm asking is because in order for us to help you, we want to be able to develop a good support system. ; Therapist: So we want to, you know, maybe in time we'll include, you know, your mom and let her know, you know, you're getting some help and getting some treatment. ; Therapist: But that was, you know, some of the questions I had for, as far as, you know, your family, how you were raised. ; Therapist: And now tell me a little bit about yourself when you were growing up. ; Therapist: Were you more of an introvert or an extrovert? ; Patient: Meaning, you know, were you outgoing? ; Patient: Yeah, I was more outgoing. ; Patient: I wanted to be, you know, in the center, in the spot, you know. ; Therapist: Yeah, attention. ; Patient: Yeah, exactly. ; Patient: That's what, you know. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: That makes people laugh. ; Patient: Attention seeker, class clown, you know. ; Patient: I was that type of person. ; Therapist: That kind of explains why, you know, this conversation is going well. ; Therapist: You're pretty much open. ; Therapist: Now, right now, how old are you Curtis? ; Patient: Twenty actually. ; Therapist: You're twenty years old. ; Therapist: And do you have any, do you have a girlfriend? ; Patient: I do. ; Patient: I have a girlfriend. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you have a girlfriend. ; Therapist: And how old is your girlfriend? ; Patient: She's seventeen. ; Therapist: Seventeen. ; Therapist: And how long, when does she turn eighteen? ; Patient: Eighteen, actually in like three weeks. ; Therapist: Oh, pretty much eighteen years old. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And do you have, how long have you known her? ; Therapist: How long have you been together as boyfriend and girlfriend? ; Patient: Not that long, for like two months. ; Patient: I've been off and on with girlfriends because it's kind of been like all drug use and they don't like to deal with it. ; Patient: So I've been kind of off and on in relationships and sometimes single, sometimes off. ; Patient: And it's been, you know, not that good for me. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So your past relationship's pretty much? ; Patient: Been gone. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Well, due to my drug program. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And your past relationships, did the, did your partners know that you were smoking marijuana? ; Therapist: Did they? ; Therapist: They came out? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Were you upfront with them or is this something they found out and therefore they said, you know, I don't want to be part of this? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, exactly. ; Patient: It was. ; Therapist: Okay, found out. ; Therapist: So some of your choices and some of your decisions had a consequence? ; Patient: Yeah, bad choices, bad decisions. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what we want to do, we want to be able to identify, you know, your problem and that's, you know, the marijuana use and then maybe what triggers, you know, you to go use marijuana. ; Therapist: And then maybe then begin to identify some of the emotions that are behind it. ; Therapist: But, you know, you growing up with six siblings, did you, all of you go to the same school? ; Therapist: Were you in different schools? ; Therapist: I mean, tell me a little bit about your school history. ; Patient: You know, I had a sister who is one year younger than me, so we were kind of on the same, you know, grade level. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: You know, me and her went to the same school for a while and she got into this honor class. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: And so she moved into an honor school and I was kind of at school by myself. ; Patient: And I went through seven. ; Therapist: And this was a younger sister? ; Patient: Yeah, this was one, she was only one year younger. ; Therapist: So you were pretty close to her. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And then during high school, I moved to seven different high schools. ; Therapist: Seven? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: It's been hard. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: But I got together just a little bit. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Around two years ago and I got my high school diploma and graduated. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Now, in high school, how did that affect you being moved around seven times? ; Therapist: Was your foster parent moving you? ; Therapist: Did you move physically in your house? ; Patient: You know what, it was actually when I was 13, as I told you, when I was 13, I moved from my foster parents. ; Patient: And when I was 13, I went to a group home. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: So, you know, when I moved from place to place, from group home to group home, the area of the city would vary, so it would kind of like be different schools. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So then you had to make a whole new set of friends. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: And that was the challenge with meeting new friends, not knowing who your friends are, what they do. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: What are some of the subjects that maybe were, that came easy to you, that you enjoyed, that were, you know, where you did well? ; Therapist: What were some of the areas that you excelled in? ; Patient: Spelling. ; Patient: I like spelling. ; Patient: I was in every spelling bee. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Never won, but I was in every spelling bee. ; Therapist: You were there. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: I like reading. ; Patient: I like spelling. ; Therapist: So spelling and reading are your strong points. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: That kind of explains why you're, you're, you're pretty good as far as, you know, being vocal. ; Therapist: You're okay. ; Therapist: You like to talk to people. ; Therapist: You engage well with people. ; Therapist: So, spelling, English, and what were some of the classes that maybe you didn't really enjoy or you had a challenge with? ; Patient: Math, science, PE, um, that's about it. ; Patient: Math, science, and PE.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Music ; Therapist: Okay Marsha, so how can I help you today? ; Patient: Well, I'm working full time, I'm a part time student. ; Patient: I've just gotten engaged and I live at home. ; Patient: There's just so much stress in my life, I have everything happening all at once. ; Patient: Just to top it all off, I failed an exam, a really big exam. ; Patient: And I just feel like I can't do anything anymore, I can't do anything right. ; Patient: I've just got so much stress and I feel like such a disappointment, such a failure. ; Patient: And I've embarrassed my family by failing. ; Patient: I just don't know what to do anymore. ; Patient: I guess I've come here today to tell you I want to leave uni. ; Patient: I guess that's why I've come here today. ; Therapist: So it sounds like a whole lot of stuff is on top of you at the moment? ; Patient: Yeah, just so much, just all piling on. ; Therapist: So you're working full time, plus part time study, and then you've got your wedding preparation. ; Patient: Yeah, just got engaged and wedding's just a month away now. ; Patient: So I've just got so much happening. ; Patient: Work is really demanding. ; Patient: Just failed this exam, don't know what to do. ; Patient: All too much. ; Therapist: So I imagine you've been sweating on this for a while and it's all been swirling around in your head? ; Patient: Yes, just been building up and building up. ; Patient: And so much pressure with everything. ; Patient: I'm living at home, so my parents, a lot of pressure. ; Patient: I need to do everything right. ; Patient: By failing this, I feel like I've just embarrassed them and disappointed them. ; Patient: I just don't feel like I'm good enough to go on studying. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Have they said much to you about failing your exam? ; Patient: They haven't said much. ; Patient: I was really scared to tell them actually, because I knew they'd just be so disappointed and just embarrassed by the fact that I did fail. ; Patient: Yeah, I've never failed anything before. ; Therapist: Wow. ; Patient: It's really hard. ; Therapist: Yeah, so it's new and you don't like it at all? ; Patient: Not at all, no. ; Patient: I think leaving uni will just be the way out, just so I don't have to go through it again. ; Therapist: Right, okay. ; Therapist: Well, I'm glad you've come to counselling, because it's good for us to get an outsider's opinion when we've got so much on our plate and we're confused as to what to do and our emotions can get in the way. ; Therapist: And you've just said earlier that a whole lot of stuff's on your plate at the moment. ; Patient: Yeah, a lot of stuff, yeah. ; Therapist: So I'm glad you've come here. ; Therapist: Here at the clinic, we use the ABC model, which is a cognitive behavioural therapy model. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, Marsha, some counsellors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use and we don't realise that we're using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Here's the list here. ; Therapist: Have a look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at the moment. ; Patient: I think number two. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Read that one out for me. ; Patient: That it's necessary to have a high degree of order and certainty in order to be happy and perform well. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, you mentioned that earlier. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Number four. ; Patient: That it's necessary to be competent and successful in all those things which are attempted. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's an expectation from your family. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Possibly number eight. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: That life should be entirely pleasant and enjoyable and that any frustration, discomfort or pain would be unbearable. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Which one of those stands out the most for you at the moment, Marsha? ; Patient: Probably number four. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How would you put that in your own words? ; Patient: That I need to be successful all the time in everything that I do. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And is that different from what's happening in your life at the moment? ; Patient: Well, failing that exam, I mean, I wasn't successful with that. ; Patient: So, yeah, I mean, it just throws out, I guess even number two, because it throws out all the order in my life. ; Patient: I need to have everything, you know, so I need to know what I'm doing, where I'm going. ; Patient: Yeah, so. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So if number four is an expectation that your family have and that you have of yourself, how do you measure up next to number four? ; Patient: I don't feel like I'm good enough. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, what I'd like to do is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC and I'll explain as we go along. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment? ; Patient: I mean, there are a lot of things, but I think obviously failing the exam was the main one. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And the consequence is you thinking of leaving? ; Patient: Leaving uni, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And that statement that you made earlier about I'm not good enough? ; Patient: I'm not good enough, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's the B one. ; Therapist: That's the crucial one. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And I'll explain it shortly when I get up to the board. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I think I'll put it up there now for you so we can work through that. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So, Marsha, the activating event, which is what you stated earlier. ; Patient: I failed my exam. ; Therapist: That's right. ; Therapist: And the kind of decision that you're thinking about is? ; Patient: Leaving uni. ; Therapist: That's right, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it's important that we consider the jump from here over to here and the kind of thinking that you've been swirling around in your head affects the consequence. ; Therapist: And you've mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And you put that in your own words. ; Therapist: What were your words before? ; Patient: That I'm not good enough. ; Therapist: Yeah, good. ; Therapist: It's really important for us to consider that kind of thinking. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay, Marsha, it's good that we've got those things on the board. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And what I'd like to do now is focus stepping out a bit from your situation and looking at it from another point of view. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: To me it sounds like you're doing a whole lot of things really well. ; Therapist: Can you list all of the things that you're doing really well? ; Patient: I'm working. ; Patient: It's a really demanding job and I'm keeping up with it. ; Therapist: Great, yeah. ; Patient: So I guess work. ; Patient: Things with my fiance, I mean, we're engaged, so planning the wedding. ; Patient: That's going really well. ; Patient: It's stressful, but it's going well. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And all of your other university subjects? ; Patient: Yeah, I've never failed anything before. ; Patient: This is the first one, so I guess all the other subjects, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: And you're succeeding in all of those things. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Put together. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're juggling it and it's a lot on your plate at the moment, but it sounds like you've been able to cope up until this point of the one exam. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: This one just threw me off balance. ; Patient: Yeah, just failing, yeah. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So would you describe yourself as successful most of the time? ; Patient: Yeah, most of the time. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And what's the evidence for that? ; Patient: Passing all my exams all the time. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Just passing my subjects, not just exams. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's right. ; Patient: Getting that full-time job, it's a great job that I'm doing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: You're getting married. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's right. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So how do all of those successes compare to that belief that I've written on the board for you? ; Patient: I guess in comparison, I am good enough. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's right. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And all the evidence is there. ; Therapist: All of the subjects that you've passed in first year and now second year. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're a full-time job. ; Therapist: That's a success. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's great. ; Therapist: Yeah, good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, what I'd like to do is get you to write that on the board. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: To dispute that belief. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Would you do that? ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: Well done, Marsha. ; Therapist: That's a powerful statement. ; Therapist: What kind of decision goes along with that? ; Patient: Staying at uni. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Write that on the board for us. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you've made a bit of a decision there, haven't you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Tell me about it. ; Therapist: Does it feel okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I feel like I should stay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Why is that? ; Patient: I can try again. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: I mean, everything doesn't have to be 100% all the time. ; Therapist: Good, good. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: So, I mean, I could re-sit the exam. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: And we've talked about all your successes. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So it's harder now to believe that top statement that I'm not good enough. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I am good enough compared to all the things that you helped me realize with all the successes that I've had. ; Therapist: That's right. ; Patient: I am good enough. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And so this idea about staying at uni, tell me about that. ; Patient: Yeah, I'll stay. ; Patient: I mean, I am good enough, so I'm sure I can give it another go and see how I go from there. ; Patient: I can re-sit the exam and I'm sure I'll be fine. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement, I am good enough. ; Therapist: Say it in front of the mirror two or three times a day so that you build up your confidence because it's going to take some time to reprogram your computer up here with that kind of positive belief about yourself rather than carrying around that other belief. ; Therapist: And we tend to carry those other beliefs for years and years and years, and so it's going to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief system. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But you've made a great start here today, so congratulations. ; Patient: Thank you! ; Therapist: Bye.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing okay. ; Therapist: Doing okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What's been going on? ; Patient: Well nothing too bad. ; Patient: I kind of got in a little bit of a bender bender accident. ; Therapist: A car accident? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What happened? ; Patient: Well, we were at a stop sign and there was one car here, another car here, and then I was here, another car was coming up behind me, and then they hit me and then I hit the car in front of me. ; Therapist: Oh. ; Patient: I kind of, you know, just the usual- Rock back and forth. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: But other than that you're okay? ; Patient: I got a couple, you know, little bruises from like hitting the steering wheel. ; Patient: I'm like, yeah, but I'm okay. ; Patient: My body's okay. ; Therapist: So physically you feel okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Were you like checked out by your physician or anything? ; Patient: Yeah, everything's okay here. ; Patient: I didn't break anything or pull anything or anything. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Emotionally? ; Patient: It's been kind of hard to like get in my car again afterwards. ; Patient: Like I've still been going to work and everything, but like I realized last night, like my boyfriend was like, oh, do you want to go on a trip this weekend? ; Patient: And I was kind of like, maybe not. ; Patient: Like I'm kind of like hesitant to get back in the car. ; Therapist: So when he said that about the trip, what was the thought that came in your mind? ; Patient: I'm going to get hurt. ; Therapist: So it was really all about the car? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It wasn't anything else about the trip? ; Patient: No, it was being in the car, driving the car. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And your thought was you're going to get hurt? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I'm going to get hit, I'm going to get hurt. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any other areas that disrupted that trip? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you normally would have went on a trip? ; Patient: Oh, definitely. ; Patient: I was kind of excited about it. ; Patient: But now I'm just like, no, I don't know. ; Patient: Or even like coming here, I was like, well, maybe I can reschedule. ; Patient: Like I was just like, oh, I don't want to drive. ; Patient: I don't want to be behind the wheel. ; Patient: I don't want to drive. ; Patient: And like when I did drive, I was fine coming. ; Patient: Like I drove the way I normally do, but I was a little bit more aware. ; Patient: But I wasn't driving extra slow. ; Patient: I wasn't driving extra fast or anything. ; Patient: But like I was checking a lot more. ; Patient: But very nervous. ; Patient: Much more nervous than usual. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How did you feel about driving cars prior to this accident? ; Patient: I was fine. ; Patient: I mean, whenever like my friends would go anywhere, I would always volunteer to drive. ; Patient: Like I enjoyed driving. ; Patient: I liked listening to the radio. ; Patient: You know, I liked my family and I always went on trips. ; Patient: And like as soon as I turned 16, like I always had a turn. ; Patient: I enjoyed it. ; Patient: I liked going on drives, just looking around. ; Patient: But now I don't, too scared. ; Patient: It doesn't even come in my mind anymore as like a thing I would want to do. ; Patient: If I can avoid it, I will. ; Therapist: So you're taking every opportunity to avoid driving. ; Therapist: So far getting like here today and getting to work, essential functions you've been able to do. ; Patient: Yeah, it takes me a while to actually, like okay, like I have to. ; Patient: And then I just kind of do. ; Therapist: So what do you tell yourself to motivate yourself to get into the car? ; Therapist: Like to come here today for instance? ; Patient: Well, it takes me, I have to kind of think about it for a long time. ; Patient: But I mean, I'm very nervous. ; Patient: I mean, I don't, I can't really think of what I tell myself. ; Patient: It just kind of happens. ; Therapist: And when you get in the car, like when you kind of work past that nervousness to get in the car, how do you feel then? ; Patient: Still pretty scared. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm pretty scared throughout the whole thing. ; Patient: I'm, you know, I'm always worried that like if I can go away that I know that doesn't have any stop lights, I'll try to go that way. ; Patient: Even if it takes me an extra half hour. ; Therapist: Oh, that long. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, how about now? ; Therapist: Like you've driven here. ; Therapist: I presume you're going to drive your own car to wherever you're going next. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So does that kind of generate those same feelings and nervousness? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Like you just reminded me of that. ; Therapist: You could feel it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So this is, this is disturbing for you. ; Therapist: This is painful for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's scary. ; Therapist: But it hasn't yet infringed on a crucial area of functioning like your job or something. ; Patient: Not yet. ; Therapist: But you're worried it might. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So prior to this car accident, how many car accidents have you been in? ; Patient: Maybe one small little thing, but this is the worst one I've been in. ; Therapist: The other one didn't bother you like this one did? ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How long ago was the other one? ; Patient: Maybe like four or five years ago. ; Therapist: Were you hurting that? ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Were you driving? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: So something about this one has triggered this nervousness. ; Patient: The other one didn't. ; Therapist: What do you think is going on? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: This one it was different because I was by myself. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: It was rainy, so maybe that, it wasn't, and it wasn't the other before, but. ; Therapist: So it was raining in the recent accident. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And I was by myself, and then the other one I had somebody with me. ; Patient: So this one maybe, I don't know. ; Therapist: Did the driver that hit you tell you what happened? ; Therapist: Like why they? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: They just, they kind of, they left pretty quickly afterwards actually, and I was just kind of left to deal with it. ; Patient: Before the police got there? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Really? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So this really shook you up. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And your worries can interfere with other areas. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So your thinking is that you're going to get hurt, you're going to get hit if you get into a car again. ; Therapist: And you're thinking it before you get into a car and really. ; Patient: During, and even after it still kind of feels like, I don't know, even though I'm not in the car anymore I'm still like, kind of worried about it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And it's really worried about another accident. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So let's look at that. ; Therapist: You were wearing your seatbelt. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And you were driving, it was a little rainy. ; Therapist: Was it day or night? ; Patient: It was like five. ; Patient: It was getting ready to be dark but it wasn't dark yet. ; Patient: It wasn't dark, it was still daytime. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So what you're nervous about driving, I mean driving does carry risk. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So I can't tell you that there's a way to completely eliminate risk with driving a car. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And you know this. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Having just been in an accident. ; Patient: But there are certainly things you can do to minimize the risks. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: What do you think some of those things are you could do? ; Patient: Always wearing my seatbelt is pretty good. ; Therapist: Good idea. ; Patient: Well, I mean like I said, I try to go ways that don't have stop signs for stop lights, which is hard but... ; Patient: That's difficult. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And I'm not sure that would really reduce the risk because you're driving longer. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you'd have to look at that case by case. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But I see your point. ; Therapist: What else? ; Patient: Oh, I don't know. ; Patient: Drive when there aren't cars around. ; Therapist: What's that? ; Patient: Drive when there aren't other cars around. ; Therapist: Which again, probably is a good idea but it would be hard to practically implement, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because you're driving to work in rush hour and driving home in rush hour. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what about driving habits that you can use? ; Patient: Make sure I don't go too fast or too slow. ; Patient: Make sure that I have space around my car. ; Patient: Make sure all my lights are working, things like that. ; Patient: Make sure I don't have gas so I don't run out of gas or have to stop or something like that. ; Therapist: So follow all applicable traffic laws. ; Therapist: Keep aware of your environment. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: You can do things that will not eliminate but will reduce the risk of an accident. ; Therapist: Now you were hit while at a red light, right? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: That one, of course, the seat belt would be helpful. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Have a car that has airbags maybe? ; Therapist: Certainly the safety of your vehicle, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: A vehicle that's safer than average would be more ideal. ; Therapist: Ultimately, I think it's a good idea to be safe, to be aware, to do your best to minimize risk. ; Therapist: And at the same time recognize that you can't eliminate it. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So there's going to be a point where we have to really work through this nervousness. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's probably actually, I mean, in a way, you're looking around more. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: But ultimately, it's probably going to hinder your life. ; Patient: Probably. ; Therapist: Because you're restricting where you go and all that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And eventually, if it gets in the way of getting to work. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Or you might lose my job or my boyfriend wasn't very happy when I said I didn't want to go. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Yeah, so you don't want it to interfere anymore. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So what can you tell yourself? ; Therapist: We talked about automatic thoughts, right? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Like I'm going to get in an accident, which really that's one of the automatic thoughts. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: What are some of the adaptive responses that you could apply when that thought comes in? ; Therapist: Right, so the adaptive response is that self-talk, that message that you say to yourself. ; Therapist: What can you say to yourself? ; Patient: Like I'm doing everything I can to make sure that I'm safe. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Like I might not be able to prevent getting hit, but I can maybe, like at least maybe I will get hurt. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You can take every precaution. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Like it's going to be okay. ; Patient: Like I don't know. ; Patient: Like you're safe, you're okay, it's okay. ; Patient: Like okay, they stopped like just to try to, like if I see somebody coming behind me and they, I'm still worried about it, like noticing that they did stop and reassuring myself that it's going to be okay. ; Patient: Yeah, it's hard because it's still, you know, fresh. ; Therapist: Yeah, it's, yeah, thoughts are strong and you believe them and you believe that you're going to get hurt. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's very real to you. ; Therapist: And still there's always that possibility, so as I mentioned, you can't eliminate the ; Therapist: risk. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So maybe one way to look at this is that you've only been in one other accident. ; Therapist: How many trips have you taken in your life in a car? ; Patient: Like a lot. ; Patient: I don't know, too many to count. ; Therapist: So it's, so the accidents are low probability events. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Scary, certainly, definitely not fun. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But they haven't happened too often considering the number of trips you've taken. ; Patient: That's true. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So another thing you could do is another adaptive response would be that I'm about to drive a car and there is an element of risk, but statistically. ; Patient: You probably won't get an accident compared to all the other times I've driven and not been in an accident. ; Therapist: Yeah, you probably won't. ; Patient: Yeah, that's true. ; Therapist: And you can reduce the risk by... ; Patient: Being careful. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, there's a part that you can, of this anxiety, I guess, that you can satisfy. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Meaning you could say, well, I can really reduce the risks and I know my chances are low in any particular one drive. ; Therapist: But there's another part of this that you, of this you kind of have to accept, which is you could be an accident. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that's not what you want and you'll do your best to avoid it, but that could still happen. ; Therapist: Do you feel like, because I know this is all very fresh with the accident being recent, do you feel like you can apply those adaptive responses when you identify an automatic drop coming in? ; Patient: I can try. ; Patient: I mean, like I can think of the times where they've come into my head and they're like, oh, no. ; Patient: And then when I realize I'm getting ready to think that, I'll be like, well, actually, it's going to be okay. ; Patient: And I can try. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, I'd like to give you some homework. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Around this anxiety. ; Therapist: We talked about the thought record, which is like where you fill out the back thought and how much it distresses you. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: In this case, it might be good to know what it's preventing you from doing. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Because your thoughts actually stopping you from. ; Therapist: Yeah, going anywhere. ; Therapist: Part of the functioning. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And then you also put the adaptive response that you applied, like what you're able to ; Therapist: say to yourself. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then how you felt after that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, what we hope is by repeatedly using the thought record and applying the adaptive response, that we'll see improvement. ; Therapist: Because the way of measuring, it's therapeutic, but it's also a way of measuring how well you're dealing with it. ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, that's kind of, you know, there's the attacking that automatic thought, disputing that automatic thought piece to this. ; Therapist: And then there's kind of the acceptance piece of it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So, there's that low but definite probability of an accident. ; Therapist: You have to kind of accept that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: At some level. ; Therapist: And you have to pay with that. ; Therapist: And then the rest of it, you know, would be acknowledging that the probability is low, and that's good, and that you're likely not to get into an accident. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you feel like you can complete a few thought records between now and the next session? ; Therapist: Yeah, I think so. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, let's do that. ; Therapist: If you feel like that's something you can be all right with. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Let's meet again in a week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And if you can have, say, two thought records. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, if that's two times and the thought came up, and then you've seen the thought record, you fill in each column. ; Therapist: And then we'll review that, and we'll see, you know, over the next few weeks if we can decrease these symptoms of nervousness and worry. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: That'd be good. ; Therapist: That'd be all right? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Thanks, Rebecca, and I'll see you in a week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Bye. ; Patient: Bye.",

; Patient: They have been bothering me. ; Patient: Well, I just started back to school last year. ; Patient: I was staying at home while my husband was working but the kids are crawling out of the house. ; Patient: So I said I was going to go back to school. ; Patient: I haven't been in school in 20 years and I thought I could handle it. ; Patient: But right now I just find myself so anxious and just so worried all the time. ; Patient: And I just don't know what to do with it. ; Patient: It's been going on for around the past 7, 8 months now. ; Therapist: About 7 or 8 months. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Would you say that this anxiety has been affecting you more days than it doesn't? ; Patient: I would say it's been affecting me, yes. ; Patient: For some time though, yes. ; Patient: More often than not, yes. ; Therapist: More often than not, yeah. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself struggling to control the anxiety? ; Patient: To control it? ; Patient: I'm just anxious all the time. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you are struggling to get under control? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Tell me about how it's been affecting, you mentioned school. ; Patient: I'm not doing too well in school right now. ; Patient: Not at all. ; Therapist: In what way?

; Patient: At home, I'm so worried about school that it's affecting my life at home. ; Patient: Like, I have this assignment, but then, oh my goodness, I'm so focused on this assignment. ; Patient: Will I have time to make dinner for the kids? ; Patient: My husband's going, oh, the house is such a mess all the time. ; Patient: And it's just causing so much conflict at home. ; Patient: My husband thinks I should be doing my housework and I'm so consumed with school. ; Patient: And then it's just such a big mess right now. ; Patient: So I'm constantly worried. ; Patient: When I'm at school, I'm worried about home. ; Patient: And when I'm home, I'm worried about school. ; Therapist: So a good deal of worrying. ; Patient: All the time. ; Therapist: All the time. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I want to ask you a few questions about this and some that might be related. ; Therapist: Do you drink or use any drugs?

; Patient: Just anxiety, like overwhelming anxiety. ; Therapist: Intense anxiety. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: But never a situation where you felt you had to flee from a room or anything like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Any past trauma? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Nothing like that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you sometimes feel keyed up, on edge, or restless? ; Patient: Restless, yes. ; Therapist: Restless? ; Patient: Restless. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself easily fatigued? ; Patient: Tired all the time. ; Therapist: Tired all the time? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Do you have any trouble concentrating or finding your mind going blank? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How about irritability? ; Therapist: Do you find yourself irritable? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: Not really irritable. ; Therapist: Any muscle tension? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: How about, I need trouble sleeping. ; Therapist: So this would be falling asleep, staying asleep, having unsatisfying sleep, anything like that? ; Patient: Well, I have unsatisfying sleep but we just moved and we live next to a factory. ; Patient: There's trucks in and out all the time. ; Patient: Who can sleep with that? ; Patient: Just chronic, just noise. ; Therapist: So you think that might be causing your sleep disturbance? ; Patient: Well, it's entirely possible. ; Patient: It's like who can sleep when you have trucks in and out all hours of the night or overnight in the wee hours of the morning. ; Patient: So it's pretty much impossible to fall asleep when you have just this noise. ; Therapist: How about before you moved there? ; Patient: I don't remember. ; Therapist: You don't remember? ; Patient: I really don't remember. ; Therapist: How long ago was it that you moved to the 4-hour now? ; Patient: A couple of years. ; Therapist: A couple of years? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So you've had this noise at night for a couple of years. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And the symptoms started 8 months ago. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: So I don't know if it's made it worse or if the noise has just been, so I don't know if it's the noise or what. ; Patient: I can't sleep through a truck. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How about any vacations or anything? ; Patient: I'm sorry. ; Patient: No vacations. ; Therapist: No. ; Patient: No vacations. ; Therapist: So you've pretty much been sleeping at your home every night for as long as these symptoms have been around. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: All right, Sarah. ; Therapist: I appreciate you answering these questions for me. ; Therapist: This has been helpful. ; Therapist: I'm going to get you a schedule with a counselor and they should be able to see you in a couple of days. ; Patient: Oh, thank you. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Therapist: I would so appreciate it just to get this under control. ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Take care, Sarah. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Okay, Mia, great job on your homework. ; Therapist: That was really excellent. ; Therapist: You listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times, and you did the in vivo exposure of walking around and touching things like doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you normally wouldn't touch, both at your house and other places you went. ; Therapist: And you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and at your mom's house. ; Therapist: And no washing. ; Patient: No washing. ; Therapist: No hand washing, no extra washing. ; Therapist: Perfect. ; Therapist: Good for you. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what did you learn from all that, do you think, over the course of the time you've ; Therapist: done that? ; Patient: It just, it got easier. ; Patient: At the beginning it was really hard, and I feel like my stats were much higher than at the end. ; Patient: So I guess that was what we talked about, the habituation. ; Therapist: Habituation, right. ; Therapist: The fact that when you do something like that that initially makes you anxious, and you do it repeatedly, especially in prolonged periods of time, your anxiety comes down. ; Therapist: We're just not built to stay indefinitely anxious. ; Therapist: You notice any other changes or anything else? ; Patient: I noticed that before doing the exposures I was really, really anxious. ; Patient: And then it kind of went down, like the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed. ; Therapist: Did that change by, say, yesterday? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Also. ; Patient: The stats were initially really high before the exposure, and then they went down the more I did them. ; Therapist: So you're saying you not only noticed that it went down during the exposure, but you started feeling less anxious even approaching these tests. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Perfect. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right, good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right, so you're doing so well, we're going to take another step up the hierarchy today like we planned, right? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So this is the dog leash day, right? ; Therapist: Did you bring it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, good. ; Therapist: All right, we'll get to that later in the session. ; Therapist: First we're going to do some imaginal exposure, okay? ; Therapist: And you remember what the purpose of that is? ; Therapist: Why are we going to do imaginal? ; Patient: That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence. ; Therapist: Exactly. ; Patient: Of getting sick in my case. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So the idea is this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and not washing, not doing your rituals, right? ; Therapist: Okay, perfect. ; Therapist: So did you write the story? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, let me see. ; Therapist: All right, good. ; Therapist: All about taking the dog for a walk without leash and what happens because of it. ; Therapist: Excellent. ; Therapist: Okay, good. ; Therapist: You know this so I'm not going to ask you to read it. ; Therapist: Okay, so in a minute when we start, what I'm going to ask you to do is to close your eyes and to sort of narrate or describe this scene that you thought about it this week and wrote out where you're handling the dog leash and very aware of the way it's contaminated and I want you to describe in the story not just what you're doing but also what you're kind of feeling and what you're thinking as you do this and then also leading to the consequences you fear from handling the dog leash and not washing. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Any questions before you start? ; Therapist: Okay, so what's your level right now? ; Patient: I would say like a 70. ; Therapist: 70, okay. ; Therapist: All right, go ahead and start when you're ready. ; Patient: Should we press play? ; Therapist: Oh, thank you for reminding me. ; Therapist: We'll start the recording so you have that for homework. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: So, I'm in my house and the dog starts barking and I know that that means that I have to take him out. ; Patient: Really don't want to so I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it but I know if the dog keeps barking he's going to wake up the baby. ; Patient: So I decide to go to the front door and get the leash. ; Patient: I'm not going to wear the gloves I usually wear so I fully experience touching the leash but I'm already feeling really anxious and I look at the leash and I see that it's gross and it's full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and it probably has saliva and other things and I see stains and I start thinking what if that's dog poop and I get sick and I just feel myself shaking and really sweaty and my heart is beating really fast. ; Patient: So I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab the leash and I get the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash. ; Therapist: What's your level now Mia? ; Therapist: Just real quick. ; Patient: Like 90. ; Therapist: 90 ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You're doing great. ; Therapist: Just keep going. ; Patient: So I grab the leash and the dog is pulling and I feel the leash kind of pushing through my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get sick. ; Patient: I want to vomit but I just keep going. ; Patient: So I walk the dog, come back home and I just leave the leash in the front door and I'm thinking I'm probably going to get sick. ; Patient: I really want to wash my hands, really want to take a shower but I try not to and I stop myself and I'm feeling really, really anxious so I can't stop thinking about washing. ; Patient: So I try to go to bed, decide to fall asleep. ; Patient: The next morning I wake up and I already feel sick. ; Patient: I know I'm sick. ; Patient: I'm shivering and I feel like I have a fever and I'm shaking again and I'm really nauseated so I go to the bathroom, start vomiting and I know I'm sick. ; Patient: I already got something I should have washed. ; Patient: I start thinking about that. ; Patient: Going to get the baby sick and I feel really, really sick. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Great job. ; Therapist: What's your level now? ; Patient: Like 80. ; Therapist: 80 ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So just keep visualizing this. ; Therapist: I'm going to describe it now and you just stay with that image as much as you can. ; Therapist: So you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. ; Therapist: Suddenly you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know that means he needs to go out and Joe's not going to be home for hours and you really don't want to take him out but you have to and it makes you scared and upset because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take him out. ; Therapist: So you walk toward the door and you think well maybe I'll just make him wait but you realize he'll wake the baby up if you don't take him. ; Therapist: So you go toward the leash and it just makes you even more anxious to see it and it's dirty and it's chewed up and it's gross and you see stains on it and you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. ; Therapist: And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar and as you go out the door and he lunges outside he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash entering your body through the pores of your skin and you feel like it's just running up your arm through your bloodstream and you keep thinking oh my god what if I get sick from this what if there's some germs in this or bacteria but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and you bring him back inside the house take the leash off and the urge to wash is so powerful so strong you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these germs off from the leash but you don't do that you don't you make yourself not do the ritual and then you go back in and just keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. ; Therapist: That night you go to sleep still anxious still upset about what happened wake up in the morning and then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick you can feel your body being sick you rush to the bathroom and vomit you can feel the fever and your body is just not right you're sick and you know it's because you handled that leash and didn't wash you didn't do the washing you needed to do and now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick and if only you had done the washing. ; Therapist: What's your level now? ; Patient: Like 80. ; Therapist: 80 okay okay you take it back and you do it again okay good job. ; Patient: Okay so I'm home and the dog starts barking.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because, as you know, we have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school, and as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule. ; Therapist: And I've been hearing some chatter from some of the other kids about a party this weekend, and from what I hear, you were there, and I can't confirm or deny anything, so I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences, but I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams. ; Patient: Right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. ; Patient: Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student. ; Patient: I usually am studying over the weekend, and my parents don't let me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. ; Patient: And when I got there, I'm not used to this party environment where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens, where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason. ; Patient: Because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else was doing, so I wouldn't be ostracized. ; Therapist: I get it. ; Therapist: We've all been there, okay? ; Therapist: I was in high school once, too. ; Therapist: I drank, too. ; Therapist: I get it. ; Therapist: There's not a ton to do in this town, and kids drink. ; Therapist: But the problem is we have these rules, and if you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules. ; Patient: I know that it's bad for me. ; Patient: It's bad for my body. ; Patient: It's bad for being on a team, for being an athlete. ; Patient: It hinders my performance. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I feel that my friends pressure me. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I feel I should go with different friend groups, maybe. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: Chris, come on. ; Therapist: You're getting peer pressure. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Being in a sports team, you have to be unified with the group. ; Therapist: Yeah, but you're one of the leaders. ; Patient: Right, and as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be ... expect them to lead not only in the sports, but also in social environments. ; Patient: If that's social, that's a social custom in our society. ; Therapist: Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker, then. ; Patient: I could, but that could also backfire on me, I feel, that I could be ridiculed for having a stick up my butt. ; Therapist: You're a star player. ; Therapist: Who's going to pick on you? ; Patient: I mean, I'm just one person. ; Patient: It's the voice of the mob. ; Therapist: Yeah, so the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking. ; Therapist: I can't be hearing that you're at parties. ; Therapist: I can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. ; Therapist: There are rules at this school, and in my job, I have to enforce them. ; Therapist: Like I said, I get it. ; Therapist: I understand. ; Therapist: I know what it's like. ; Therapist: I get that you want to have fun. ; Therapist: Your teenage years. ; Therapist: I get that, but you are a star player. ; Therapist: We want to keep you on the team. ; Therapist: We got to figure out a way to get through this. ; Patient: Well, I'll dedicate the time not to party. ; Patient: Not party, but you get involved with alcohol to that extent, and have it publicized on the internet. ; Therapist: What do you mean? ; Patient: Like on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw on the internet. ; Patient: I'll avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time put on the internet so others can see. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Yeah, I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're going to be on the team, okay? ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I will stop. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: You promise? ; Patient: I promise. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Shake? ; Patient: Shake. ; Therapist: We'll see you later. ; Patient: See you later. ; Therapist: All right.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Michelle, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm kind of doing, I'm feeling a little bit stressed out. ; Therapist: Stressed? ; Patient: Yeah, I feel like I have a lot on my plate. ; Patient: I have this test that I have to take for work. ; Therapist: What kind of test? ; Patient: It's like an aptitude test. ; Patient: It has math problems on it and scenarios in order for me to move up to the assistant manager position. ; Therapist: Right, and that's a job that you've been interested in for a while. ; Therapist: Yes, it is. ; Patient: That's what you've been talking about. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: So, I've been just feeling a lot of anxiety about taking the test and then they actually scheduled for me to take the test and I just got really overwhelmed and I started, I felt my heart was racing, I felt like my hands were shaking and I just really couldn't concentrate on the test even though the night before me and my friend did practice problems and I knew all the answers with no problem, like I didn't miss any of the questions. ; Therapist: You know the material on this test pretty well. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: But the feelings and that physiological response to heart rate and the sweating, the feelings of anxiety plus those physiological responses, they got in the way of you completing it, if you were able to complete it? ; Patient: No, I wasn't able to complete it and thankfully they gave me a chance to come back. ; Patient: I just told them I didn't feel well. ; Patient: So they rescheduled. ; Patient: So now I'm feeling a lot of anxiety because I'm scared the same thing is going to happen when I go back. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you weren't feeling great about taking the test in the first place? ; Patient: The day, the night before I felt like I know all the answers but the minute I walked into the room, all of a sudden all these fears kind of took over. ; Therapist: But did you know that was coming? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: You did? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So you had some anxiety in advance? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Or not? ; Therapist: You did? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I had some anxiety the day before but when I reviewed it with my friend, I'm like, oh, I know the answers. ; Patient: I thought that would kind of push it down but I think once I got there, it all came back up to the surface. ; Therapist: It erupted in that moment and that prevented you. ; Therapist: What do you think is leading to this? ; Patient: Well, I've always kind of struggled with tests. ; Patient: Like I can remember when I was in third grade, I had to take this test because I was really struggling in math. ; Patient: And I had to pass this test in order to move to the next grade. ; Patient: And I thought just like this test that I was ready for it. ; Patient: I had to tutor and I felt really prepared for it. ; Patient: And then when I took it, I failed and I was held back. ; Patient: And I feel like, you know, that was so, it was really embarrassing for me to be held back. ; Patient: I felt like, I don't want to say but I did feel like a failure at the time because I felt like I really did know this so I don't know why I couldn't pass the test. ; Therapist: And since that, so this was third grade? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And since that, they had testing experience. ; Therapist: Have you had trouble with tests since? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: I always feel really anxious. ; Patient: I mean, I'm able to pass tests obviously because I graduated from grade school and went on to high school. ; Patient: But it's so hard for me because of this anxiety that I feel that even though I may think I know it, I may still fail the test anyway. ; Patient: Maybe like a repeat of what happened. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So in third grade, you had a really bad testing experience. ; Therapist: And as you moved forward from there, you've never really been thrilled about taking tests. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: But you've been able to adapt. ; Therapist: You've been able to take them and still pass them. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, sometimes I get an A. ; Therapist: That's good, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, yeah, it is good. ; Patient: But yeah, it's good. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: But with this particular test, which is not for school, which is for work, this one, this is more a stumbling block for you. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Do you have any ideas as to what may be making this test such a point of anxiety for you? ; Patient: I think it's just the fact that it's this promotion. ; Patient: It's almost like the same thing. ; Patient: If I fail, I'm being held back. ; Patient: And I feel like it's reliving that moment of being held back. ; Patient: And that's like a fear that I have that by not being able to pass these tests, they're holding me back. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So really that same feeling you had in third grade, that's coming up with this test now. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I didn't put them together until now, but yeah. ; Therapist: And the other test you'd taken throughout the rest of grade school and high school, they didn't have that same value attached to them. ; Patient: No, because they didn't have all that pressure that it was either win or lose, basically. ; Therapist: You could take them again or take that course again. ; Patient: Or I could take another test to raise the grade if I didn't do good on that test. ; Therapist: So you maybe had more options in school. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: It wasn't pass or fail. ; Therapist: So it's the pressure. ; Therapist: It's the pressure of you need to get through this. ; Therapist: You don't have the safety nets that you had in school. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: If I fail it, then I'm not going to be able to get the promotion. ; Patient: I would have to wait just like I did. ; Patient: I'm going to have to wait a certain amount of time, I think an year before I could take it again. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So that is a lot of pressure. ; Therapist: That is a lot of pressure. ; Patient: Yeah, it is. ; Therapist: So is there any time limit to this test for work? ; Patient: No, there isn't. ; Therapist: There's no time limit? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And how many, is it like a multiple choice? ; Patient: Yes, it is. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And you seem like, like you said you were studying the night before with your friend. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: You're really well prepared for it. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So I have a few thoughts about this. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: One is I'm wondering, you know, we've talked before about cognitive therapy, about the core beliefs. ; Therapist: So I'm curious as to what you think about like what core belief may be operating for you now with this test, this work test. ; Patient: That I could fail, and then if I fail, I could end up being a failure at all, you know, the things that I try. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So something like I'm a failure or I'm bound to be a failure, I'm destined to be a failure. ; Patient: I would say like I'm destined to be a failure. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I'm destined to be a failure. ; Therapist: So that potentially is a core belief, right, that's operating. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, that's what scares me. ; Patient: That's exactly the thought that I'm thinking when I'm about to take the test, that if I don't pass it, it's just going to have like this domino effect of failure. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it could be a core belief, but it's also, it seems like it's still an automatic thought. ; Therapist: Like as you get ready to take that test, you're thinking, I'm destined to be a failure. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And you're having what sounds like a panic response, right, with the heart racing. ; Patient: Yeah, and my hands shaking. ; Therapist: Hands shaking. ; Therapist: Are you in the room alone when you're taking the test? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: You are. ; Therapist: So no one's really seeing you have this, I wouldn't want to call it a panic attack yet. ; Therapist: We haven't really gotten that far into it, but it sounds like it has some panic-like features. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because it's not, it's interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get through the items. ; Therapist: So okay. ; Therapist: So one thought I have is, have you ever had panic attacks in the past or anything like this? ; Patient: Only when I'm... ; Therapist: Other than the third grade thing? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Patient: I mean, sometimes I get worked up when I'm about to take a test. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: But it's only around tests. ; Therapist: And what happens once you get worked up? ; Therapist: Like once your heart rate increases and you have the other physiological symptoms, what... ; Patient: When I actually do take the test? ; Patient: I kind of try to work through it and start trying to answer one question at a time to get to the last question. ; Therapist: So one possible strategy here is, we talked about the adaptive response, right? ; Therapist: So which is that thought that you say to yourself, that self-talk. ; Therapist: I wonder if your adaptive response couldn't be, I can ride this out. ; Therapist: Like you have no time to go on a test. ; Patient: Yeah, that's true. ; Therapist: I mean, the panic response is only maintained for so long. ; Patient: And I could also choose maybe questions that I know the answer to automatically. ; Patient: So that could help maybe relieve some of that stress. ; Therapist: To get some, in a sense, to get some minor victories under your belt by answering those right, you know you're closer to achieving your goal. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: And then I feel like I know, at least I know that they'll validate the feeling that maybe I can pass this test. ; Therapist: So the more items you answer correctly, the less anxious you're going to feel because you're closer to the end of. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Patient: Because then I start to feel more calm because I know that, I know these questions are definitely going to be right. ; Therapist: So that's one, well that's a cognitive and behavioral strategy, right? ; Therapist: Like you can wait out the panic. ; Therapist: I mean, you're in the room alone. ; Patient: Yeah, that's true. ; Patient: Nobody's there. ; Patient: Nobody's going to see me if I'm kind of trying to get myself together. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Now the panic's painful, right? ; Therapist: The panic symptoms are painful. ; Therapist: So what you could tell yourself is, yeah, this is unpleasant, but I can ride out these symptoms because they only last so long. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: So I could use like self-talk. ; Therapist: Exactly. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because usually I mean panic symptoms can run, you know, five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, but you have no time limit. ; Patient: So I can take a, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So if you can just kind of use that time to focus on the items, as you mentioned, that you could get right and kind of at the same time be telling yourself, I can ride this out. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I've done that in the past, so I can apply it to this test. ; Therapist: So that's worked for you? ; Patient: Yes, that has worked for me in the past. ; Therapist: So that's certainly one adaptive response to try, right? ; Therapist: Another one could be that although it wouldn't be great to fail, you can retake the test in a year, right? ; Therapist: You could try again. ; Patient: Yeah, that's true. ; Therapist: I mean, I know that's not what you want, but the alternative is kind of buying into that automatic thought. ; Therapist: We know that's not working, right? ; Therapist: I'm destined, that was the word, right? ; Therapist: Like I'm destined to be a failure. ; Therapist: We know that's not working for you. ; Patient: So even if I have to take the test again in a year, then I'm not going to be a failure because I still have the chance to take it again. ; Patient: It's not like I'll never be able to take this test again. ; Therapist: Yeah, you just have another year to study, right? ; Therapist: And of course, you wouldn't have that promotion that time, and that would be an outcome I know you don't want, but it's not the end of your career. ; Therapist: It's not like something so drastic, right? ; Therapist: It's important to you, and I can appreciate that, but it's not the end of your career. ; Therapist: You're not going to be unemployed. ; Patient: No, no, definitely not. ; Patient: And just thinking back and relating it back to the third grade, even though I had to stay back, I still managed to do well the next year and keep moving up. ; Patient: And it hasn't really, in the long run, prevented me from doing anything that I wanted to do. ; Therapist: So that's great. ; Therapist: That's another adaptive response, which is I've survived this before. ; Patient: Yes, I definitely have. ; Therapist: So this one event, I mean, I know you had the incident in third grade with the unpleasant experience, but this one event, you don't want to let this kind of fashion, well, use your word, your destiny, right? ; Therapist: This was one unpleasant event that seemed to catch you off guard with the panic-like symptoms, and fortunately, your employer is going to give you a chance to try this again. ; Therapist: I imagine you can ride out these symptoms, and I think you have the other adaptive response, which is I've been successful with this before. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Definitely, I feel a lot better now because I just know that no matter what happens, I've been here before, and I can get through it as opposed to that feeling that I'm going to just fail altogether. ; Therapist: All right, so what we'll do is, when do you have to take the test? ; Patient: Next week, next Wednesday. ; Therapist: Next week. ; Therapist: All right, so let's schedule one more appointment right before that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: We'll make sure that you have these adaptive responses down and you're ready to go. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And really, we'll kind of focus on the positive outcome, right? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Which is just taking this test, taking one item at a time, and fighting through some of these physical symptoms you're having. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And fighting through the unuseful thoughts. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: I mean, that sounds good because it helped me prepare for the test. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: So, Michelle, I'll see you then and we'll work through it. ; Therapist: I really appreciate you coming in today. ; Patient: Okay, thank you.",

; Therapist: I understand there have been some difficulties lately that brought you into the agency. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Tell me what's going on. ; Patient: About a week ago, I went out with some friends to a boxing match. ; Patient: I didn't really want to go. ; Patient: I've never really been to one. ; Patient: It's not really something I'm interested in. ; Patient: But I went just to hang out with my friends and stuff. ; Patient: I watched a few fights, and this one fight, this guy, nothing was really happening. ; Patient: I wasn't really into it, but this guy got knocked out right in front of me. ; Patient: It was really close to the ring. ; Patient: He got knocked out right in front of me, fell right on his face, and I just saw him lifeless in front of me. ; Patient: And I just ever since then, it's happened the same. ; Patient: I had to leave right away. ; Patient: I just couldn't be there anymore. ; Therapist: What did you notice right away? ; Therapist: One of the boxers was knocked out. ; Therapist: You saw that. ; Therapist: What did you notice right away that was happening? ; Patient: I just felt really, really scared. ; Patient: My heart started racing. ; Patient: I couldn't focus on what was going on around me. ; Patient: I just had to get out of there. ; Patient: So I don't even really know what happened to him, if he was okay or not. ; Patient: So I just couldn't handle how I was feeling, so I had to leave. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you left, and the symptoms, they continued? ; Patient: Yeah, pretty much daily for the past week. ; Patient: I got home that night. ; Patient: I couldn't sleep. ; Patient: It took me almost all night to fall asleep. ; Patient: And then at work on Monday, I was having a lot of problems there. ; Therapist: What kind of problems? ; Patient: I couldn't focus when anyone was talking to me. ; Patient: I had a meeting on Tuesday, and my boss was talking for a while. ; Patient: I felt like I couldn't concentrate at all. ; Patient: Everything was just a blur around me. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you find that you're having memories of the incident at the boxing match that are intrusive? ; Patient: Yeah, I think about it a lot, pretty much all the time. ; Therapist: And it's bothersome for you? ; Patient: Yeah, if I'm at work trying to get some paperwork done or something, it just pops in my mind, and I can't make it go away. ; Therapist: And you try, but the memories stay there. ; Therapist: Any dreams related to the... ; Patient: No, I haven't really been dreaming about it. ; Patient: I'm barely sleeping, so... ; Therapist: Any times when you feel like you're reliving what you saw, like you're seeing it again? ; Patient: No, not really. ; Patient: I just think about it a lot. ; Therapist: You think about it? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Is anything reminding you of the boxing match, and then that's causing you to have symptoms? ; Patient: At the end of my meeting, people started clapping, you know, this big cheering, and that kind of made me feel really bad. ; Patient: Again, my heart was racing. ; Patient: I started sweating. ; Patient: It just kind of reminded me of being there, and I started thinking about it again. ; Patient: So things like that, you know, I pump up music when it comes on the radio, same kind of music they played there. ; Patient: That kind of makes me feel the same way. ; Patient: My heart starts to race. ; Patient: I just kind of feel like I need to get away from it. ; Therapist: Do you find yourself working to avoid, like, music that was similar? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I've been trying to really avoid the radio, because you never know what's going to come on on the radio. ; Patient: So I've been avoiding listening to music in case something like that happens and avoiding crowds. ; Therapist: Do you find that you've had any trouble remembering what happened? ; Patient: No, I can pretty vividly remember it. ; Therapist: It's pretty clear to you? ; Patient: Yeah, when I think about it. ; Therapist: Have you been irritable at all since the... ; Patient: Yeah, you know, just out of nowhere. ; Patient: If something doesn't go the way I want it to, I just kind of snap on people. ; Patient: And that's not like me at all. ; Patient: I usually am pretty easygoing. ; Patient: And, you know, people, my boyfriend, for instance, I yelled at him the other day for not putting the toilet paper on the roll. ; Patient: And that's not something I'd usually care about. ; Patient: It's just, it's not me. ; Therapist: How about your awareness level of what's around you? ; Therapist: Do you find that your awareness level has increased, that you're more aware? ; Patient: Um, it kind of depends. ; Patient: Sometimes I kind of feel like I'm in a daze and don't really know what's going on around me. ; Patient: But, um, I've been, um, one of the students that I work with, he popped out from behind the door, which he would do all the time. ; Patient: And, you know, typically I would laugh and think it was funny before, but he did it the other day and I just could not control myself afterwards. ; Patient: Like, I couldn't calm myself down. ; Patient: You know, I didn't think it was funny at all. ; Patient: It really, really scared me. ; Patient: And that went on for about 10, 15 minutes and I just, my heart was racing. ; Patient: I had to go take a walk. ; Patient: And it was just really hard to relax again after that. ; Therapist: So you feel like your reaction to that was stronger than it normally would have been? ; Patient: Definitely. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you used drugs or alcohol recently? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Any medical problems? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: So Jackie, I'm going to get you in to see a counselor here at the agency if that's something that you're okay with. ; Patient: Yeah, I think that would be really helpful. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Just take a couple days to get you on the, to get you in to see somebody, to get you on the schedule and get you in to see somebody. ; Therapist: And I'll get that arranged. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Patient: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Music ; Therapist: Okay Marsha, so how can I help you today? ; Patient: Well, I'm working full time, I'm a part time student. ; Patient: I've just gotten engaged and I live at home. ; Patient: There's just so much stress in my life, I have everything happening all at once. ; Patient: Just to top it all off, I failed an exam, a really big exam. ; Patient: And I just feel like I can't do anything anymore, I can't do anything right. ; Patient: I've just got so much stress and I feel like such a disappointment, such a failure. ; Patient: And I've embarrassed my family by failing. ; Patient: I just don't know what to do anymore. ; Patient: I guess I've come here today to tell you I want to leave uni. ; Patient: I guess that's why I've come here today. ; Therapist: So it sounds like a whole lot of stuff is on top of you at the moment? ; Patient: Yeah, just so much, just all piling on. ; Therapist: So you're working full time, plus part time study, and then you've got your wedding preparation. ; Patient: Yeah, just got engaged and wedding's just a month away now. ; Patient: So I've just got so much happening. ; Patient: Work is really demanding. ; Patient: Just failed this exam, don't know what to do. ; Therapist: All too much. ; Patient: So I imagine you've been sweating on this for a while and it's all been swirling around in your head? ; Patient: Yes, just been building up and building up. ; Patient: And so much pressure with everything. ; Patient: I'm living at home, so my parents, a lot of pressure. ; Patient: I need to do everything right. ; Patient: By failing this, I feel like I've just embarrassed them and disappointed them. ; Patient: I just don't feel like I'm good enough to go on studying. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Have they said much to you about failing your exam? ; Patient: They haven't said much. ; Patient: I was really scared to tell them actually, because I knew they'd just be so disappointed and just embarrassed by the fact that I did fail. ; Patient: Yeah, I've never failed anything before. ; Therapist: Wow. ; Patient: It's really hard. ; Patient: Yeah, so it's new and you don't like it at all? ; Patient: Not at all, no. ; Patient: I think leaving uni will just be the way out, just so I don't have to go through it again. ; Therapist: Right, okay. ; Therapist: Well, I'm glad you've come to counselling, because it's good for us to get an outsider's opinion when we've got so much on our plate and we're confused as to what to do and our emotions can get in the way. ; Therapist: And you've just said earlier that a whole lot of stuff's on your plate at the moment. ; Patient: Yeah, a lot of stuff, yeah. ; Therapist: So I'm glad you've come here. ; Therapist: Here at the clinic, we use the ABC model, which is a cognitive behavioural therapy model. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, Marsha, some counsellors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use and we don't realise that we're using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Here's the list here. ; Therapist: Have a look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at the moment. ; Patient: I think number two. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Read that one out for me. ; Patient: That it's necessary to have a high degree of order and certainty in order to be happy and perform well. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, you mentioned that earlier. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Number four. ; Patient: That it's necessary to be competent and successful in all those things which are attempted. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's an expectation from your family. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Possibly number eight. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: That life should be entirely pleasant and enjoyable and that any frustration, discomfort or pain would be unbearable. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Which one of those stands out the most for you at the moment, Marsha? ; Patient: Probably number four. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How would you put that in your own words? ; Patient: That I need to be successful all the time in everything that I do. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And is that different from what's happening in your life at the moment? ; Patient: Well, failing that exam, I mean, I wasn't successful with that. ; Patient: So, yeah, I mean, it just throws out, I guess even number two, because it throws out all the order in my life. ; Patient: I need to have everything, you know, so I need to know what I'm doing, where I'm going. ; Patient: Yeah, so. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So if number four is an expectation that your family have and that you have of yourself, how do you measure up next to number four? ; Patient: I don't feel like I'm good enough. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, what I'd like to do is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC and I'll explain as we go along. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment? ; Patient: I mean, there are a lot of things, but I think obviously failing the exam was the main one. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And the consequence is you thinking of leaving? ; Patient: I live in uni, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And that statement that you made earlier about I'm not good enough. ; Patient: I'm not good enough, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's the B one. ; Therapist: That's the crucial one. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And I'll explain it shortly when I get up to the board. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: I think I'll put it up there now for you so we can work through that. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So, Marsha, the activating event, which is what you stated earlier. ; Patient: I failed my exam. ; Therapist: That's right. ; Therapist: And the kind of decision that you're thinking about is? ; Patient: Leaving uni. ; Therapist: That's right, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it's important that we consider the jump from here over to here and the kind of thinking that you've been swirling around in your head affects the consequence. ; Therapist: And you've mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And you put that in your own words. ; Therapist: What were your words before? ; Patient: That I'm not good enough. ; Therapist: Yeah, good. ; Therapist: It's really important for us to consider that kind of thinking. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay, Marsha, it's good that we've got those things on the board. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And what I'd like to do now is focus stepping out a bit from your situation and looking at it from another point of view. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: To me it sounds like you're doing a whole lot of things really well. ; Therapist: Can you list all of the things that you're doing really well? ; Patient: I'm working. ; Patient: It's a really demanding job and I'm keeping up with it. ; Therapist: Great, yeah. ; Patient: So I guess work. ; Patient: Things with my fiance, I mean, we're engaged, so planning the wedding. ; Patient: That's going really well. ; Patient: It's stressful, but it's going well. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And all of your other university subjects? ; Patient: Yeah, I've never felt anything before. ; Patient: This is the first one, so I guess all the other subjects, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: And you're succeeding in all of those things. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Put together. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're juggling it and it's a lot on your plate at the moment, but it sounds like you've been able to cope up until this point of the one exam. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: This one just threw me off balance. ; Patient: Yeah, just failing, yeah. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So would you describe yourself as successful most of the time? ; Patient: Yeah, most of the time. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And what's the evidence for that? ; Patient: Passing all my exams all the time. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Just passing my subjects, not just exams. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's right. ; Patient: Getting that full-time job, it's a great job that I'm doing. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're getting married. ; Patient: Yeah, that's right. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So how do all of those successes compare to that belief that I've written on the board for you? ; Patient: I guess in comparison, I am good enough. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's right. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And all the evidence is there. ; Therapist: All of the subjects that you've passed in first year and now second year. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're a full-time job. ; Therapist: That's a success. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's great. ; Therapist: Yeah, good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, what I'd like to do is get you to write that on the board. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: To dispute that belief. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Would you do that? ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: Well done, Marsha. ; Therapist: That's a powerful statement. ; Therapist: What kind of decision goes along with that? ; Patient: Staying at uni. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Write that on the board for us. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you've made a bit of a decision there, haven't you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Tell me about it. ; Therapist: Does it feel okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I feel like I should stay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Why is that? ; Patient: I can try again. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: I mean, everything doesn't have to be 100% all the time. ; Therapist: Good, good. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: So, I mean, I could re-sit the exam. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: And we've talked about all your successes. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So it's harder now to believe that top statement that I'm not good enough. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean, I am good enough compared to all the things that you helped me realize with all the successes that I've had. ; Therapist: That's right. ; Patient: I am good enough. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And so this idea about staying at uni, tell me about that. ; Patient: Yeah, I'll say. ; Patient: I mean, I am good enough, so I'm sure I can give it another go and see how I go from there. ; Patient: I can re-sit the exam and I'm sure I'll be fine. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement, I am good enough. ; Therapist: Say it in front of the mirror two or three times a day so that you build up your confidence because it's going to take some time to reprogram your computer up here with that kind of positive belief about yourself rather than carrying around that other belief. ; Therapist: And we tend to carry those other beliefs for years and years and years, and so it's going to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief system. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But you've made a great start here today, so congratulations. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Bye.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Okay Charles, let's take a look at your homework from last week, the activity schedule. ; Patient: Not very much on it. ; Therapist: I'll take a look at it, let's see. ; Therapist: Well, you did complete most of it. ; Therapist: Okay, I don't see mastery ratings, but you have pleasure ratings for everything. ; Therapist: So that's good. ; Therapist: So let's see, you woke up at eight, you drank coffee and read the paper and you rated that as a two for pleasure. ; Therapist: You went to the grocery store, rated that as a three. ; Therapist: Let's see, at noon you ate a sandwich and watched TV and you rated that as a two for pleasure. ; Therapist: You took a nap and then the mail arrived and you looked at bills and you rated that as a two for pleasure. ; Therapist: You ate dinner at a Chinese place and rated that as a three and then you watched some more TV and rated that as a two. ; Therapist: Okay, so tell me about the mastery ratings, Charles. ; Therapist: What made it difficult to complete those? ; Patient: I don't see the point. ; Patient: And I mean, how do you master watching TV or eating a meal? ; Patient: If I had tried to use chopsticks, I suppose it would have some mastery involved in that. ; Patient: But I didn't mess with chopsticks. ; Patient: Food was okay, but not great. ; Therapist: So it was tough. ; Therapist: And I just want to be clear though, Charles, that this is very typical though for many people that we work with. ; Therapist: It's very difficult to complete homework worksheets because things happen, right? ; Therapist: I don't feel that well sometimes, things getting in the way. ; Therapist: There's things that just prevent me from doing that. ; Therapist: So I think our job together is to try to figure out what are the sort of barriers that make these sort of things difficult. ; Therapist: So what would you say, what would be some barriers that made it difficult to complete your mastery ratings? ; Patient: I don't enjoy anything. ; Patient: And I used to enjoy a lot of things. ; Patient: But I don't even look forward to breakfast particularly. ; Patient: A cup of coffee. ; Patient: The news is mostly bad if there is news. ; Patient: The paper doesn't carry much national news anymore. ; Patient: So I mean I have to eat, but I really don't see the point of a lot of things. ; Therapist: Okay, okay. ; Therapist: Well I think something that will be useful for both of us, Charles, is to collaboratively work together and figure out how we can look at the perceived benefit of doing some of these things versus the cons. ; Therapist: So there's a worksheet that I have called a decisional balance worksheet. ; Therapist: And it basically takes two separate decisions. ; Therapist: One decision is to engage in activities and there's some benefit to doing that. ; Therapist: And then another decision would be to not engage in activities. ; Therapist: There's benefit to that. ; Therapist: But there's also cost to both of those decisions. ; Therapist: So I think one objective way for you and I to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are the sort of things you could do and determine whether there's more benefit or cost to completing that. ; Therapist: What do you think about that? ; Patient: Okay, sure. ; Patient: That sounds okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So let's take a look at this decisional analysis and I'll explain it to you. ; Therapist: Okay, so here's the worksheet. ; Therapist: Here's a pen. ; Therapist: As you can see, Charles, there's four boxes. ; Therapist: And at the top of the boxes, there's one decision which is to change. ; Therapist: So it's the decision to engage in activities. ; Therapist: Well, if we're honest about it, there are benefits to doing that. ; Therapist: If you look at the right box, there's also cons and costs to doing that. ; Therapist: At the bottom of the worksheet, the other decision is to stay the same. ; Therapist: And if we're honest, there's benefits to staying the same. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: But there's also cons or costs to staying the same in the right-hand box. ; Therapist: So our decision, our job together is to try to figure out which makes the most sense for you. ; Therapist: So let's start with the most obvious one and that would be to engage in activities since that's what we've been talking about. ; Therapist: So what would be some perceived benefit of engaging in certain activities to you? ; Patient: Well, that would depend on the activity, I know. ; Patient: But I could get in touch with somebody. ; Patient: I could call a friend, maybe try to meet somebody for lunch. ; Therapist: Okay, that's a great idea. ; Therapist: So what would be a benefit of calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch? ; Patient: Well, I would enjoy the company. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: And I wouldn't be as lonely, I suppose. ; Therapist: Okay, that sounds great. ; Therapist: So it sounds like one benefit would be you'd enjoy the company. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you wouldn't be as lonely. ; Therapist: So I'd write that down. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Those are really good. ; Patient: Company. ; Therapist: Company. ; Therapist: And you said not as lonely. ; Patient: Not lonely. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay, can you think of the downside to potentially doing that? ; Patient: Well, one downside might be that he wouldn't be interested in having lunch with me. ; Patient: I haven't been a whole lot of fun lately. ; Patient: Or he might be busy and might not be able to have lunch. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Or he might want to talk about what's going on in my life and I really don't want to talk about that with somebody. ; Patient: Talk about it with you, of course. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds like the most practical one of those would be that he may be busy. ; Therapist: That could be the downside is that he could be busy. ; Patient: Right, okay. ; Patient: Might not be able to come. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I'd write that. ; Therapist: So great job, Charles, with the top two boxes with the first decision. ; Therapist: So let's move to the second decision, which would be to stay the same. ; Therapist: And there's some benefit to that and there's some cost to that as well. ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: Okay, Charles, so we completed the worksheet. ; Therapist: So what's your overall impression about the benefits of changing versus the cons and staying the same? ; Patient: Well, it makes sure that the benefits outweigh the cons if I make the change. ; Patient: If I don't make the change, I'll be doing just what I've been doing and I'll be getting up wondering what's the point and will still be lonely. ; Patient: And if I do call somebody and if they do say sure, then I'd have at least some time with somebody else whose company I enjoy. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Those are good observations, Charles. ; Therapist: So which activity does it make the most sense to try for homework this week? ; Patient: Well, I called somebody, I think. ; Therapist: Okay, that's a good observation. ; Therapist: So let's say for homework, then you try to call someone to get together with a friend. ; Therapist: And how about also trying to complete a full day of the activity schedule and completing both the mastery and the pleasure ratings? ; Therapist: What do you think about that? ; Patient: Sure. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And if it gets difficult, which again, that's pretty normal for that to take place. ; Therapist: If it gets hard, we can talk about it next time and we can problem solve together and figure out how to remove those barriers. ; Therapist: Does that sound good? ; Patient: Sure. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: Good, thanks. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well. ; Therapist: Thanks for asking. ; Therapist: I understand you had some symptoms recently that have been bothering you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Could you tell me about those? ; Patient: Yeah, probably for the last eight months, maybe a year even, I have this position at work where I have to make these weekly presentations and it's killing me. ; Patient: I can't do it anymore. ; Therapist: Tell me about how these presentations are set up. ; Patient: So it's the executive director and it's ten managers and we're kind of sitting in a circle and everybody goes around and does like a weekly program update. ; Patient: Five minutes or so, maybe ten at the most if there's an issue that kind of needs to be discussed. ; Patient: But everybody takes turns speaking and it goes around, kind of around in a circle. ; Patient: And depending on where you sit is what order you present in basically. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And you say that this situation with the presentation, you said it's killing you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What do you have in it? ; Patient: I feel like it's constantly on my mind. ; Patient: I'm constantly worried about this presentation and even though I only have to speak for like five minutes, I'm so consumed by this part of my job that I can't do anything else. ; Patient: And I normally, I feel like I do good in my job but this. ; Patient: And it builds up more like every day. ; Patient: The day before is really bad because I'm prepping for the meeting and so it really starts to consume me then. ; Patient: I don't sleep the night before and then by the time I get to the meeting, I'm so anxious and so nervous. ; Patient: I'm panicking. ; Therapist: You're panicking. ; Patient: And I just can't. ; Patient: I just can't. ; Therapist: So this is distressing for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And this is probably difficult to talk about. ; Therapist: At the beginning of the meeting, what would be your anxiety level? ; Therapist: What's going on then? ; Patient: By the beginning of the meeting, when I've sat down, I feel like I'm breathing harder. ; Patient: I'm starting to sweat and I feel like my face is turning red. ; Patient: My palms are really sweaty. ; Patient: I'm constantly having to wipe them off on my pants. ; Patient: My heart is racing and I feel like, you know, the closer it gets to being my turn, I feel like everything just gets worse. ; Patient: I feel like I'm breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder. ; Patient: I feel like everybody can hear it. ; Patient: My stomach just gets in knots. ; Patient: I feel nauseous. ; Patient: There have been times that I've managed to just hold my hands still and just sit really still and I've tried some deep breathing and just sat and have made it through and have made it to my presentation and been able to speak. ; Patient: But even then when I speak, I stutter and I stammer over my words and I don't say everything I need to even though I have a cheat sheet essentially and I can read from it. ; Patient: I still feel like I'm missing things and I'm leaving things out. ; Patient: My voice doesn't project so I end up speaking very softly and like I said, I'm stuttering. ; Patient: I just can't get it even then, but it's still, I feel like it's still a mess. ; Therapist: So you're not happy with the quality of your presentation? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Even when you're able to kind of stay there and conduct it. ; Therapist: So I want to divide this into the stages. ; Therapist: So we talked about the very beginning. ; Therapist: So you're already having anxiety. ; Therapist: It sounds like it's fairly intense at that point. ; Therapist: Tell me about as they go around the table and give their brief presentations, tell me about what you're feeling as the presentations come around to you. ; Patient: Well, if I manage somehow to get there early enough and I can get an early enough seat like to sit like right next to my boss or like one or two away, then I'm actually pretty okay because I can kind of get it over and done. ; Patient: But so many times I'm so nervous and honestly a bit hungover because I've been drinking to try and I don't feel anxious when I drink. ; Patient: So there have been a lot of times that I've woken up a little bit late because I've been drinking and so by the time I get there, I'm like one of the last, it's one of the last seats, so I'm one of the last to go. ; Patient: And so as it gets closer and closer to me, I just feel more and more anxious and panicky and here in the, especially in the last few weeks, I've had to leave. ; Patient: I can stay. ; Patient: I've had to go. ; Therapist: So before the presentations come around to you, you get up and leave the room. ; Therapist: So in those times when you've stayed in the room and you've done the presentation, so the anxiety, the panic, the heart rate, the sweaty palms, all these symptoms are increasing as they go around the table or the room. ; Therapist: And when it comes to you actually giving your presentation, you're not happy with it, but what's your anxiety level like during your presentation? ; Patient: I feel like during the presentation, I feel almost like everything, it's like everything stops and then when it's done and it goes to whoever's next, it's like, it's almost like a physical sense of relief, like, okay, that's over and everything starts to relax and calm down, but then I feel miserable. ; Patient: I am so, so upset with how I performed that more than anybody else that, well, really that everybody is like, what is wrong with her, but that my boss especially is like, why did I give her this job again? ; Patient: And I feel so, so miserable that I feel like I've disappointed him and so I've disappointed me. ; Patient: And I mean, this has always, always happened to me for as long as I can remember. ; Patient: I've never been able to speak in front of groups. ; Patient: And from back in college, if I had to make a presentation, I would ask the teacher if there was a way out of it. ; Patient: And if they refused, then I wouldn't present. ; Patient: And I had a teacher who insisted that I make the presentation and I dropped the class and I took it again with a different teacher that wouldn't make me present because I couldn't do it. ; Patient: And high school was the same, that I would, you know, I just wouldn't do it. ; Patient: And actually, this is ridiculous. ; Patient: You know, I mentioned drinking. ; Patient: I've been drinking for a really long time. ; Patient: And when I was like, I don't know, like 13 or 14, I got busted for underage drinking and I had to do some like adolescent treatment and I had to do this like group therapy with these other kids and I couldn't do that. ; Patient: I bolted out of the room. ; Patient: And so I've never been able to do this, ever. ; Therapist: So you've had these symptoms for a long time. ; Therapist: They've been frustrating you for a long time. ; Therapist: How about periods of time where you haven't had to be in front of other people? ; Patient: Well, if I haven't had to be in front of other people, I've been kind of okay. ; Patient: You know, I can go to the movies, but I like to sit on the end. ; Patient: You know, I can go out with my family and my friends and we can go shopping, but I don't like to go to new places. ; Patient: I like to go kind of like the same places that I've been. ; Therapist: Familiar with them. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: Because then I know them. ; Patient: You know, I know the layout of stores and things like that. ; Therapist: All right, so it interferes with your functioning maybe a little bit, but if you're not having to present, it's not as big a deal as it is now for you with this job. ; Therapist: This is really affecting you. ; Therapist: So are you taking any measures or have you taken any measures other than the drinking you mentioned to avoid the situation? ; Patient: Oh, definitely. ; Patient: I mean, there's, like I said, I mean, I've run out of the meetings. ; Patient: There's been times that I've called in sick when I haven't been. ; Patient: There's been times when I've said I've had car trouble, arrived so late that it was unreasonable to make my presentation. ; Patient: I've actually talked to my boss about possibly not doing the presentation and just giving my notes to him or to brief him before or after. ; Patient: Because I don't want to say that I have this problem. ; Patient: I mean, normal people don't do this, right? ; Patient: I mean, normal people can make these presentations. ; Patient: I mean, the rest of the staff can do it. ; Patient: Why can't I? ; Patient: And so I don't want to tell him that, you know, that there's something wrong with me. ; Patient: I mean, it's gotten to the point that I've talked to him about, you know, this other position that's in another department and transferring so that I won't have to do this anymore. ; Patient: And it would be a pay cut. ; Patient: I mean, it's a demotion. ; Patient: But I can't live like this. ; Therapist: This is too painful. ; Therapist: If you had the other job, this other job would involve presentations. ; Therapist: So you'd be happier. ; Therapist: You'd have fewer symptoms in that job. ; Therapist: What's been the result of that discussion? ; Therapist: Has there been anything that's happened as far as? ; Patient: Well, he's told me that he thinks I'm doing a good job. ; Patient: Excuse me. ; Patient: And he doesn't want me to change positions. ; Patient: But I can't do this anymore. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you've tried to cope with anxiety. ; Therapist: You've had to leave, call in sick or come in late. ; Therapist: You've looked for a different position where it doesn't involve presenting. ; Therapist: You've had this problem in other circumstances, the group therapy and in presentations before. ; Therapist: Do you or have you seen any symptoms like this in your parents? ; Patient: Yeah, both of my parents and my sister actually. ; Patient: We would kind of joke about it sometimes that we all get so nervous. ; Patient: And my sister, I don't know how, but she managed to find a job where she doesn't interact with anybody. ; Patient: It's her in her office with her computer by herself. ; Patient: And it's just her. ; Patient: I don't know how she pulled it off. ; Patient: I mean, she hardly talks on the phone. ; Patient: And she's really happy. ; Patient: And my parents, they actually met in college. ; Patient: When my dad, after my mom made a presentation, my dad, I guess, leaned over and was like, you know, I could tell you were really nervous, but you did great. ; Patient: And they just, they seemed to bond over this nervousness that they both had. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So there may be a history, a family history of symptoms like these. ; Therapist: This is distressing for you. ; Therapist: You tried to avoid it and deal with it, but you haven't been, you don't feel you've been very successful coping with it. ; Therapist: We'll get you in for treatment. ; Therapist: We'll get you in the next couple of days to see a counselor, if that's what you'd like to do. ; Patient: Yes, please. ; Therapist: I think that could help. ; Therapist: And I want to thank you for spending this time with me. ; Therapist: It's really helped me to understand better what you're facing. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks, Sasha.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hello, my name is Dr. Todd Brondet. ; Therapist: Welcome to part two in my series on clinical interviewing. ; Therapist: This is a role play exercise. ; Therapist: I'm here with Nell Kelly, a graduate assistant here at Wilmington University, and she'll be role playing the same character, Anne, in part two and all the parts of these videos. ; Therapist: So I want to remind you that this is just for educational purposes and your agency may have different requirements when it comes to what needs to be included in a clinical interview. ; Therapist: And remember, all clients are individuals, so you may need to add or subtract different elements to provide a ethical and appropriate clinical interview. ; Therapist: So I'll turn it over to Nell to introduce some of the elements you'll be seeing in part two. ; Patient: In this second section of the intake interview, Dr. Brondet will be eliciting information about the client's childhood, relationship history, and spirituality. ; Patient: Let's get started. ; Therapist: Okay, Anne, so I'm going to ask you some questions about your developmental history. ; Therapist: Some of these you might have already answered during the screening, but it's important that I capture them here as well. ; Therapist: What city and state were you born in? ; Patient: Wilmington, Delaware. ; Therapist: Okay, and how about what city and state were you raised in? ; Patient: Wellington, Delaware. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you speak any other languages other than English? ; Patient: Spanish. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Not fluently, pretty well. ; Therapist: Pretty well? ; Therapist: Can you tell me who raised you? ; Patient: My parents. ; Therapist: Your biological parents? ; Patient: My dad. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: At any point during childhood were you ever raised by anybody else temporarily? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No, okay. ; Patient: My grandmother lived with us for a little while, but we had like middle school through high school. ; Therapist: Can you tell me briefly what your life was like growing up? ; Patient: Yeah, it was pretty normal childhood I guess. ; Patient: My mom was, she was kind of angry, an angry person. ; Patient: But it was, you know, my two sisters and me and my parents. ; Patient: We didn't want for anything. ; Patient: My parents loved us pretty much. ; Patient: And you know, we went to good schools. ; Patient: My mom, you know, my mom was pretty angry. ; Patient: Well at least towards me. ; Therapist: Not so much toward you? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I mean sometimes my sisters and my dad, she was like angry in general. ; Patient: I guess I got the most of it. ; Patient: I kind of think, I don't know, I was wondering if it was connected to my boss and the women at work. ; Patient: I don't know, that's kind of why I'm here. ; Patient: And it happened in the neighborhood too, the women in the neighborhood after we moved to this new neighborhood. ; Patient: And I'm really feeling like it's me and groups of women. ; Patient: And is there, I don't know, I don't know, you're the expert. ; Patient: But you asked me what my childhood was like. ; Patient: Like I can't complain. ; Patient: I wasn't like abused. ; Patient: Like I said, I was hit sometimes, but that was the way, I was hit more than my sisters for sure, was the oldest. ; Patient: My sisters were, I was the oldest. ; Patient: My middle sister was, I don't know, do you want this? ; Patient: Did I answer your question? ; Therapist: No, no, please go on. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: My sisters were perfect. ; Patient: You know, my middle sister was, you know, she always got good grades. ; Patient: She did exactly what my parents wanted. ; Patient: She was the one, like, she'd wake up by herself several hours before school started and get herself all ready, make herself breakfast, you know. ; Patient: And she was just always a good girl. ; Patient: And I mean, I wasn't a bad girl or anything, but I don't know. ; Therapist: So the family dynamic you're speaking about, when did that change? ; Therapist: Or has it changed? ; Therapist: It hasn't changed. ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Therapist: At what age did you move out of your home? ; Patient: College. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: She'd be around 19, something like that? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: We talked about this a little bit earlier, about how your experiences when you were young, how were you disciplined as a child? ; Patient: You know, yelling. ; Patient: My mom yelled a lot. ; Patient: And like I said, she didn't hold back from, you know, smacking my face or pulling my hair or something like that. ; Patient: When I was younger, when I got older, she didn't do it as much. ; Patient: You know, I could kind of push her away. ; Patient: But it wasn't, you know, I don't know. ; Patient: Yeah, that was it. ; Patient: Or, you know, other than that. ; Therapist: How was your father? ; Patient: He was kind of quiet. ; Therapist: He didn't get involved in the discipline component? ; Patient: No, I mean, that was Mom. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: I want to move on now to relationship history. ; Therapist: I'm going to be switching gears a little bit again. ; Therapist: You mentioned that you're married. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you been married before?

; Patient: Yeah, it's happy. ; Therapist: Happy. ; Patient: It's a happy marriage. ; Patient: I mean, he gets concerned about me. ; Patient: You know, when I go through my sad periods or whatever. ; Patient: But no, it's basically a happy marriage. ; Patient: He's a good guy. ; Patient: I'm lucky. ; Therapist: Does he know that you're safe in council? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Is he supportive of that? ; Patient: Yeah, he, it was kind of his idea. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: At first. ; Patient: I thought he was right. ; Patient: I wanted to try it again. ; Therapist: At some point, and I don't know this yet, but at some point, if appropriate, would he be willing to come in for a session with you? ; Patient: Definitely. ; Therapist: Would you be okay with that? ; Patient: Yeah, sure. ; Therapist: Does your spouse have any trouble with any of the following? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Substances, gambling, mental health, medical? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing? ; Therapist: And how long have they been married? ; Patient: Um, fifteen years. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about any previous relationships you might have before marriage? ; Therapist: Like a boyfriend or something like that? ; Patient: Um, yeah. ; Patient: I had a pretty serious boyfriend in graduate school. ; Patient: And then in college, you know, I dated a couple guys. ; Patient: And in high school, I had one boyfriend through high school. ; Patient: But we broke up. ; Patient: And when we both went off to college. ; Therapist: So I'm going to switch now to parental history. ; Therapist: Do you have any children?

; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: They did? ; Patient: Yeah, on a roll. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: Now you mentioned you have a daughter. ; Therapist: And I know you talked earlier about your relationship with your mother. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you see any of that, what happened there playing out between you and your daughter? ; Patient: Um, not really because I try so hard. ; Patient: I mean I get mad sometimes. ; Patient: I can feel myself flare up and, um, but, uh, I don't know. ; Patient: You know, I don't, I don't, I don't think so. ; Therapist: You don't think so? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Anything else about your children you want to tell me? ; Patient: Um, well, a couple of years ago when I was kind of in one of these periods, um, my son's teacher, he was in second grade at the time and she said she was concerned about him that he was, um, kind of hanging out away from the other kids. ; Patient: Um, she thought he might be depressed, um, is what she said. ; Patient: So we took him to see somebody a couple times but, you know, he was okay. ; Therapist: He's okay now? ; Patient: He's okay now, yeah. ; Therapist: It had you worried a bit though? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: In the situation? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: I'm going to switch gears again. ; Therapist: Are you still comfortable moving forward? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: This concludes part two of my video series on clinical interviewing. ; Therapist: As always, I hope that you found my video useful. ; Therapist: If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me. ; Therapist: I'll be happy to assist you. ; Therapist: At your convenience, I would encourage you to now move on to part three to watch the conclusion of the video series. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, Shari. ; Therapist: How you doing today? ; Patient: Great. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well. ; Therapist: Thanks for asking. ; Patient: That's awesome. ; Therapist: So you're doing great? ; Patient: I am doing awesome. ; Therapist: I know your brother brought you in today and he had expressed some concerns about your ; Therapist: mood. ; Therapist: Do you know what that's about? ; Patient: I think he's worrying for no reason because I, you know, I, for the last like week and a half, I have been following my passion, which is baking. ; Patient: And I didn't realize this before because I worked in an office and I just realized that that's not what I want to do with my life. ; Patient: And I know what I want to do with my life now and I've never known before. ; Patient: So this is an amazing feeling. ; Patient: And what I want to do is I want to start my own baking business. ; Patient: So what happened was that a couple, like two weeks ago, my nephew had a bake sale and I've always, you know, I've always been like like baking, but I've always been like from the box or like from, you know, whatever. ; Patient: So I tried for the first time making brownies from scratch and they were amazing and everyone loved them at the bake sale and they sold out and my nephew thought I was a hero. ; Patient: Basically I was. ; Patient: And so now it made me realize like I could do this for a living and it would make me feel amazing and make me feel like a hero for all these people. ; Patient: And I live by a college campus, so it'd be kind of cool if I could like put up something about like delivering the bakery, like to dorms or like baked goods to dorms because you know college students love that type of thing. ; Patient: But so anyway, so I was thinking about, long story short, having this business and I would bake all these cookies and I'm just going to put up flyers because I don't, I'm not like at the point where I can get like an office space, but I don't need an office space because I have my apartment and I have everything I need in my apartment to bake everything I need. ; Patient: And I can also, I'm a BJ's membership, so I can go to BJ's and I can get everything I need in bulk, so like all the flour and butter and sugar and all that stuff. ; Patient: So it's not an issue if I just do it from my apartment. ; Patient: And so I was putting up flyers and trying to promote my business and that's what I've been working on for the last week and a half and I feel great and it's amazing. ; Patient: And that's basically it. ; Therapist: Alright, so you feel like everything's kind of going your way and you're really excited about the new business idea. ; Therapist: I know your brother was a little concerned with how much you've been spending on the business idea and he mentioned some things about different relationships you've had that are new. ; Patient: Okay, so there's a couple things with that. ; Patient: So with the spending, like I don't think my brother recognizes that when you start a business like you need to invest in it to begin. ; Patient: And I understand why he's worried because like, so at work, well at the office job that I had, I got in trouble because obviously you need to make flyers and I was like, oh he doesn't realize I'm frugal, I'm smart, so I was like I'll make the flyers at work and put them out at the work computer so that I'm not having to pay like wherever, like staples or something to go ahead and put them out for me. ; Patient: So I got in trouble because it was like for personal use and I was using the work whatever. ; Patient: But like that's what annoys me about my brother because like the new guy that I met, which is the other thing with the relationships, like this new guy is so supportive of my ideas. ; Patient: I met him actually in a bakery, which is like destiny, and he was so supportive when I told him about what I was planning and actually the other guy that I was talking to before, and I've been talking to him for a while, he was kind of like my brother and was like, are you sure this is something you want to do? ; Patient: And like I don't understand why you would say that to someone who's obviously sure of what they want to do. ; Patient: Like I know I can do it, I know that I'll be successful, like did they not taste the brownies at the bake sale? ; Patient: Like they were amazing. ; Patient: And so that's kind of where I am and that's why my brother's worried, but he shouldn't be because like I had all this planned out. ; Therapist: Alright, he's worried that you don't, one of the things was the new relationship that you don't know the guy too well. ; Patient: Well, I mean, I've hooked up with him a few times, like I know him pretty well and I don't think he understands like the connection that we have. ; Patient: Like it's a pretty strong one. ; Therapist: Alright, so your brother just doesn't, in your mind, he just doesn't get it. ; Patient: No, and like he doesn't like pay attention to me when I talk. ; Patient: Like I'll be trying to tell him about like the bake sale and, well not the bake sale, well a little bit about the bake sale, like I tried to tell him about how successful it was and he just thought that I was like bragging, but I wasn't. ; Patient: Like it was genuinely like a success. ; Patient: And then I tried to tell him about my business idea and like he's like trying to like brush it off like it's not a good idea and that's why. ; Patient: So he just doesn't listen to me, so sometimes I try not to talk to him about it. ; Therapist: Alright, have you noticed through all this any change in sleep patterns? ; Patient: I haven't been sleeping as much, but I think that's just because I'm so excited about this and like so I've been like staying up late and waking up early and like looking at recipes and honestly it hasn't really been an issue because I haven't been tired at all. ; Patient: I've really, yeah I haven't, I've felt rested. ; Patient: I get enough. ; Therapist: Alright, so you do feel rested. ; Therapist: But you haven't been sleeping as much. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And you clearly seem like you're in a good mood, no sadness or anything like that. ; Patient: No, like you're not going to have sadness when you're following your passion. ; Therapist: Alright, so you're doing pretty well that way. ; Therapist: Have you ever been down or depressed? ; Patient: Yeah, in the past I have been. ; Patient: Actually not too long ago, about four months ago, I was hospitalized because I was so down. ; Patient: But you know, and I don't feel like that now and I know what it feels like to be down and I don't have any of that stuff. ; Patient: Like I feel so much more hopeful and happy and just great with where my life is going right now. ; Therapist: Alright, do you ever feel this way before? ; Therapist: Kind of in a really good mood? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like this? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So what do you think brought all this on? ; Patient: Honestly I just think it's like getting to know myself and getting to know like what I want to do which is this, you know, culinary arts. ; Therapist: It's kind of realizing that's kind of changed your life? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: For the better, like really for the better. ; Therapist: Alright, and you mentioned before that you got in some trouble at work, right? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: How bad did that turn out? ; Patient: Pretty bad. ; Patient: Like it was like a final written notice so if any little thing at this point could make me lose my job but I'm not too worried about it because at this point I'm putting so much time into the baking business that if something goes wrong with my like office job like I'll have this. ; Patient: Like in, I'm sure that in as short as a month like I'll be making money soon and a lot of money because I know how much time I'm going to be putting into this, how passionate I am about it and I know that like I'll be able to make the money back that I've put into it so I'm not worried about it. ; Therapist: Alright, but you're not too worried about that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any medical conditions you know of? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: How about drug and alcohol you say? ; Patient: No, I don't use anything like that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Are you seeing or hearing anything that other people can't see or hear? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No, nothing like that? ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Sherry, so I know that you're feeling pretty well but I would like you to see a counselor maybe help you as you contemplate these different things we've been talking about if you'd be okay with talking to a counselor. ; Patient: I guess I'd be fine. ; Therapist: You'd be okay with that? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: I'll get that set up. ; Therapist: It'll just take a moment and I want to thank you for answering my questions. ; Therapist: This has been helpful. ; Patient: You're welcome.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Lisa, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing okay. ; Therapist: Did you make it here okay to the office? ; Patient: I did. ; Patient: Traffic wasn't too bad. ; Therapist: Good, good. ; Therapist: So I understand that you've come to see me because you have a situation. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm just been a lot of anxiety right now. ; Patient: My oldest child is moving out and I know as a mom that that's the goal is to let them be independent and start on their own but still a little concerned that it's going to work out and that he's in a good place and living where he should and going to eat dinner and do those things that you worry about them doing. ; Therapist: Okay, I'll try to help you with that. ; Therapist: I'm sure your year gets started. ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Patient: The sooner the better. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: I want to make sure I go over a few disclosures about the counseling relationship before we get into assessment which is the first stage. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: We'll ask you a lot of questions. ; Patient: Alright. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: About your past and what's going on now and then after assessment we'll move into counseling. ; Therapist: So we'll come in roughly once a week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then we'll get through kind of a piece on confidentiality. ; Patient: Okay, so like attorneys what you can do and not do and... ; Therapist: Kind of. ; Therapist: I'm glad you brought that up about attorneys. ; Therapist: Attorneys and clients have confidentiality and counselors and clients have confidentiality but the two types are different. ; Therapist: So I'll explain to you how it will work between you and I but know that is a little bit different than it works between attorney and their client. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Can you explain the differences to me? ; Therapist: Absolutely. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So you want to think about a counseling relationship all this time you spend here, the notes that I'll take during the assessment and the progress notes later on because I'll have a chart with your name on it and it will be stored in a secure place. ; Therapist: All that is confidential and next to that word confidential is an asterisk. ; Therapist: Right? ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: There's exceptions. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what I'm saying to you are those exceptions to confidentiality because confidentiality isn't absolute. ; Patient: So there's times you might tell someone else something that I said? ; Therapist: Yes. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah, but there are very specific situations that occur that permit that or mandate that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And I want to review those with you before we move on. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I'd like to know that before I tell you anything. ; Therapist: I agree. ; Therapist: That's a good way to look at it. ; Therapist: So the first exception to confidentiality is when you give me permission to release information that you've disclosed and interactions we've had in counseling. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: This is actually fairly common. ; Therapist: For example, do you have a primary care physician? ; Patient: I do, yes. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So depending on what we talk about, you may want him or her to know about our discussions. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then you would have to sign a release that gives that physician the right to talk to me directly. ; Patient: That makes sense. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Furthermore, your issues with or part of your concern is with your son. ; Therapist: So say, and I don't necessarily foresee this, but say later on as we work together, you want him to come in for a session just to talk about something. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: And then you would have to sign a release to that confidentiality so he could be here and talk with me. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: That makes a lot of sense. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: The other exceptions are you have an insurance company. ; Therapist: So when you fill out your screen packet, insurance companies have access to progress notes, the assessment, anything on the chart. ; Therapist: And they're generally responsible for this information. ; Therapist: I don't know of any instances where they're irresponsible with it. ; Therapist: But I just think it's important that you know that anything I write in the chart, anything in the chart itself, technically the insurance company can ask for it. ; Therapist: And periodically could review. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Again, I've never seen in my career any difficulty with that. ; Therapist: But I just want to let you know that information would be transmitted offsite, so to speak. ; Therapist: And when this agency bills, it would be transmitted, your information would be transmitted offsite to the insurance company. ; Patient: So it goes automatically, whatever progress notes you have automatically go to the insurance company? ; Therapist: The progress notes don't for standard billing, but information about the type of session we had, the length of the session, and some other personal information about you to identify, you would go to them. ; Patient: Oh, okay. ; Therapist: So they know a service was provided. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But like I said, they're generally very responsible for that information. ; Therapist: Large companies have done this for a while. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: They get all your medical stuff too, so they have it up. ; Therapist: They have access to a lot of different types of data. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Another exception to confidentiality, and again, I don't foresee necessarily any of this happening, but I want to tell you about the limits of it, is in the event that I feel that you're going to harm, or there's a high potential that you're going to harm yourself or someone else. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: In that instance, I'm obligated to act. ; Therapist: Now we're going to probably talk about a lot of different elements of your life through the next however many weeks we're together. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: When, and if, and again, I don't predict this, you have some sort of suicidal ideation or you want to harm somebody else. ; Therapist: In the unlikely event that happens, I would only release the information I have to release to protect you or the person that I'm worried about that you might harm. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So if you reveal a lot of like deep, dark secrets, and then you tell me that you want to go harm a relative of yours, right? ; Therapist: I have a duty to warn that relative of what you plan on doing, where you are at the moment, what threats you've made, but I'm certainly not going to tell them about your deepest darkest secrets you revealed. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Unless they're directly relevant to protecting them. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: That's very unlikely they would be. ; Patient: I'm not planning on hurting anybody, but we should be good. ; Therapist: I know. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I know that this confidentiality, the information I release, is limited to just what I need to release. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Similarly, if you have any type of suicidal ideation and I had to contact somebody to come pick you up, like law enforcement, I would only tell them what I needed to tell them for them to get you to the hospital and get you in a safe environment. ; Therapist: This I want to take an opportunity to talk about the suicidal ideation to let you know that just because you have suicidal ideation, like thoughts, a lot of people think about suicide from time to time, or even homicidal ideation or thoughts you're going to harm someone, not necessarily you're going to kill, but it's harm, does not by any means automatically mean I'm going to call the police. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Think of it as something that opens a discussion, certainly, about your safety and someone else's safety, but that's not, we don't go automatically from there, that is, if you have any thoughts, suicide to the hospital. ; Therapist: There's a discussion and many, most, the vast majority actually of people that have suicidal ideation do not have any intent or plan to commit suicide. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: So you say, so if someone's thinking about it, you are not just going to call the police and send you to the hospital, you're going to try to get to the bottom of it first. ; Therapist: Absolutely. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: That, you know, I have a responsibility to make sure you're safe and I feel like I can do that if we talk through an issue and you don't have any, you don't have any reason to believe you're going to harm yourself, but just have a suicidal thought. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: That's a lot different than you came into me and told me about a detailed plan and you really seem like you're going to do it, then I'd be a lot more worried. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: That makes sense. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So that exception of confidentiality is really used in the most extreme cases of suicidal ideation. ; Therapist: Another exception in this state that I want to let you know about is if I have any reason to believe that a child or an elderly person is being abused, I have to report it. ; Therapist: It's called a mandated reporter. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Now I'm sure that you're not abusing and it's older than anyone. ; Patient: No, I'm not abusing anyone. ; Therapist: Or elderly people. ; Therapist: But I want to explain how this exception works because it's a little more far reaching than you may think. ; Therapist: So say that you come in and you discuss with me a neighbor that seemingly has nothing to do with your treatment. ; Therapist: I just casually mention that something's going on and that discussion leads me to believe that your neighbor's abusing their child. ; Therapist: I still have to report that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Even though it has really nothing to do with you directly, it's something you just told me in passing, I'd have to act on it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And again, I would only release the information necessary to protect that child's safety. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: It does, yes. ; Therapist: So no matter how I find out about it or who it is, I have to act on that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then the last exception I want to review is, again, as with many of these, very unlikely. ; Therapist: But if for some reason you're involved in a type of civil or criminal litigation and a judge orders me to testify, I have to testify. ; Therapist: I can tell you this happens very rarely, but it can happen. ; Therapist: And I can and will try not to disclose. ; Therapist: I'll ask the judge to not disclose if you don't want me to. ; Therapist: But ultimately a judge can't order me and I have to. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So in the end it's up to the judge. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I understand that. ; Therapist: So again, most of these pretty unlikely. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But I'd rather you have all the information going forward so you don't have any concerns about where the information you're revealing or talking about, where the information is going. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you have any questions about that? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Patient: It seems pretty clear. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, I appreciate you sitting through that talk on confidentiality. ; Therapist: So we're going to get started now with the assessment. ; Patient: Okay.",

; Patient: Feels really good. ; Therapist: I'm sure it does. ; Therapist: It really does. ; Therapist: Yeah, it's been really a process. ; Therapist: So that's fantastic. ; Therapist: Tell me about what's been going on this week. ; Patient: I had a good conversation with my mom. ; Therapist: Oh, nice. ; Patient: Yes, so it feels good. ; Therapist: Tell me about it. ; Patient: We, so I just talked with her on the phone. ; Patient: And yeah, it just went really well. ; Patient: And we actually, after that, we planned a Skype meeting. ; Patient: So we had a Skype meeting last night, I guess it was. ; Patient: And yeah, caught up a little bit and kind of talked about some things. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Oh, nice. ; Therapist: Nice. ; Therapist: I'm happy to hear about that. ; Therapist: And I don't remember, I'm trying to think from last time, like any Alan updates or? ; Patient: Still seeing Alan. ; Therapist: Oh, nice. ; Therapist: Nice. ; Therapist: Things going OK? ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: Well, I'm happy to hear that. ; Therapist: And then I guess the other thing that I wanted to talk with you about, I know that we kind of had mentioned it briefly, but today kind of marks the kind of beginning of that kind of final phase for us. ; Therapist: So then over the next three sessions, we're going to be starting to kind of wrap up our work together. ; Therapist: And yeah, I've been feeling that way too, because it's hard to want to bring that up, because it's been really just great working with you. ; Therapist: And so I really don't want to see that come to an end. ; Therapist: But I thought one of the things that's really important is maybe just to get us starting to talk about, and again, we don't have to do it all today, but just at least get us starting to talk about some of the changes that you've made, things that have gone really well for you, and really maybe kind of recap how it is that you've gone from almost like binging daily to almost now you're not at all. ; Therapist: And maybe we can kind of talk about how that's gone. ; Therapist: Because I think the other thing that's really important is not only the things that you've done in terms of how things have gotten better for you, but I also want us to start thinking about too, like, OK, what's going to happen when we kind of get to the end of our work together and beyond? ; Therapist: So in terms of how you will kind of keep the work going. ; Therapist: And so I kind of thought, I feel like I'm kind of being like a wet blanket here. ; Therapist: You've had a really great week, and now I'm bringing up our kind of departure. ; Therapist: But I think it's really important to kind of mark that and mark that transition, and also to mark it too by having things go so well. ; Therapist: I think it's really important. ; Therapist: And I guess the first thing I want to talk about is I guess I'm pointing my pad of paper, because it's like it's so filled with just all the different things that have occurred for you over the last several weeks. ; Therapist: And I think the first thing that's really notable to me is I really have really appreciated your willingness to engage your mom, because I know that that's been so hard for you, and it's been so painful, the way that she's treated you in the past. ; Therapist: But that I guess I'm even getting kind of emotional talking about it, because it's just been so rich, the transition you've made in terms of the way you've engaged her in a more genuine way and allowed her kind of back into your life. ; Therapist: And it seems like that that's been really vital to your getting better. ; Therapist: So what's, in terms of like from your perspective, kind of what's that been like for you, kind of emotionally? ; Patient: And it feels good. ; Patient: It's nice not butting heads with her. ; Therapist: Yeah, I'm sure. ; Patient: I want a good relationship with my mom. ; Patient: I don't choose purposefully to not have a good relationship with her. ; Patient: Yeah, it feels really good. ; Patient: And I feel like I can have better relationships other places as well now, because that's healthy. ; Therapist: Right, right. ; Therapist: And also too, I think along with that is that kind of the strategies I think that you've, my hunch would be is that some of the strategies that you've used to engage your mom in a more meaningful way have really kind of come in handy in some respects in terms of like some of the other relationships that you've had. ; Therapist: Especially I know that you and Kathy have gotten a lot closer, and even the fact that you've allowed yourself to kind of connect with somebody else, like with Alan. ; Therapist: I know that you were talking with me the other day about some other friends that you've met and people that you've really gotten a little bit closer to. ; Therapist: So that's been really exciting. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ; Patient: It feels good to not go home and feel terrible. ; Therapist: Right, yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: So then kind of from your perspective again, we'll talk more about this. ; Therapist: I mean, I realize I'm kind of putting you on the spot, but as you've kind of have thought about it or thinking about it, and maybe you can think about it too even from now into the next couple of sessions, but just starting to think about like what is it that you've really done that you really feel like it's been really, that's really helped you make changes in the way in which you've managed your food or your binge eating? ; Patient: I mean, just really trying to be more positive within my relationships and being more open and communicating, not keeping things in. ; Patient: I feel like when I kept things in, it kind of boiled up and that's what made me want to use something that made me feel better. ; Therapist: Right, right. ; Patient: And that, yeah, I mean like if something bothers me to like immediately express it instead of holding it in. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: You know, I've noticed that as well and it seems like that that's been one of the important things that you've done that's really helped with the changes that you've made. ; Therapist: What else feels like that? ; Therapist: I mean, obviously that's been really important, but what are the other things that you've noticed in terms of like how it's been going? ; Patient: I feel better about myself and like not having comments from my mom anymore and having a guy in my life who really likes how I look and yeah, just yeah, feeling happier with myself and grades are good. ; Therapist: Yeah, I know, you know, things like we're really in a good space. ; Therapist: And I think the other thing too I was aware of that we, you know, that you had mentioned to me in particular last time was that, and I didn't get a chance really to talk with you as much about it because I think we had so much to talk about last session, but I was really struck by the fact that you, it seems like you haven't been as body conscious as you have been in the past and I didn't know if you've noticed that. ; Patient: Yeah, I know. ; Patient: I feel like I've noticed, like a little bit noticed it, yeah, especially that you bring it up. ; Patient: It's true. ; Therapist: Yeah, because I know like initially and even like there have been times even along the way when you'll make like, you know, I didn't feel like it looked very good or I felt like something felt really tight on me or, you know, I just felt like that other people were looking at me or maybe judging me. ; Therapist: But it seems like that as we've kind of moved along that there's really been, I've really noticed a real kind of a little bit of a shift in the way in which you've kind of been regarding yourself and it seems like it's been a little bit different. ; Patient: And not hearing like any comments at all from my mom about any of that stuff or I feel like I've gotten to the point where I'm not concerned like that I'm going to hear a comment either. ; Therapist: Right, right. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and make you talk about it anyway, but what did you do in order to be able to get those comments though to stop? ; Therapist: Because obviously I think you did something really significant with her. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: I mean I thought about what you said about really acknowledging that that put a lot of pain on me and stress and weight and yeah, no, I was able to let her know that. ; Patient: It was hard. ; Patient: I was scared to tell her that, but I mean she recognized that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: And yeah, she kind of explained how she thought that she was helping me or she wanted me to have a lot of friends in high school. ; Therapist: Right, right. ; Patient: And that's what she, I mean she kind of said like her mom said the same thing to her. ; Therapist: Right, right. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, well you know and that's really not uncommon when you have, it's funny that just even like, not to be a big research head, but it seems like that that's pretty consistent that kind of like mothers to daughters who become mothers to daughters, like sometimes it's kind of what we call this intergenerational transmission of like kind of criticality about shape and weight. ; Therapist: And so I'm really proud of you that you kind of had the courage to address it with her directly and just let her know how you feel. ; Therapist: Because I think as a parent I know that you always, I always want to try to do the right thing and I always, I don't purposely want to try to inflict pain on my children even though my daughters would suggest that I probably do. ; Therapist: But in general I don't, that's not my goal is to be harsh and critical. ; Therapist: In fact, I really always try to really be helpful. ; Therapist: I think most parents try to do the right thing, but I, and I think maybe your mom just didn't realize the degree to which that really bothered you and how much that hurt. ; Therapist: And in many respects how much that kind of really drove you to really take it out on yourself so to speak. ; Therapist: And so for you to have the courage to bring that up I think was really helpful. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: So I really think that that made a lot of differences as well as kind of reaching out to others and again, just the open expression of your feelings. ; Therapist: So yeah. ; Therapist: So yeah, I think the things that we're doing like now I think I'd really like to see us kind of continue to, you know, obviously you still are doing a lot of really good work in terms of like the things that you're talking about. ; Therapist: But yet I am also aware that as we're over the next couple sessions we can kind of keep doing a few of these things kind of wrapping up. ; Therapist: And then our last session we can more or less kind of formally say goodbye and talk about kind of like what the next steps are and some things that you might want to be paying attention to or things you might want to be mindful of. ; Therapist: But we'll get there. ; Therapist: So yeah. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Great.",

; Patient: I would say that, you know, I was accepted into the program. ; Patient: Like there's kind of like a pretty rigorous sort of testing and stuff which I passed to get in interviews and such to get into the program. ; Patient: So I did that. ; Patient: Like I said, I'm a pretty good student all considering, you know, before this kind of like was happening. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you got through a rigorous process to become a student, you're doing well. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You mentioned before just the one bad grade, right? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So if, you know, you have friends in this program, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: If one of them came to you with this balance of, you know, one bad grade and some anxiety versus passing, you know, rigorous standards and doing well otherwise, what advice would you give them? ; Patient: I mean now that you're kind of like talking about it like a, you know, this or that sort of thing, it makes sense I would probably say that, well, you seem to be doing pretty well so far, you know, that anyone evaluating would look at all of the cumulative how you're doing your performance rather than that of weight. ; Therapist: Would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself? ; Patient: I think I try to sometimes, but my anxiety symptoms kind of like really like you were saying your anxiety tells you sort of, I think I can think that, but I think my anxiety symptoms are such in the moment that it's really hard, you know, and I'm replaying what happened before in my head, anticipation, predicting that it will happen again. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So let's look at the thought and the feeling. ; Therapist: If you had to rate the percentage that you believed, this thought, this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program, like right now. ; Patient: Right now. ; Therapist: So if you're here with me, how much of your mind believes that that's true? ; Patient: I would say like, you know, a two or a three, like not very, I don't believe it very much right now because, you know, I'm not presenting and it's just you and I, not like a group full of people. ; Patient: So that's, that pressure is not there here. ; Therapist: So right now you're really not buying the idea that you're not good enough? ; Patient: Yeah, correct. ; Therapist: To be in the program. ; Therapist: So now let's move to, let's say right in the, near the end of like presentation when that anxiety is there and the classmates, they could be looking at you, they could be negatively evaluating you, like that's what you're worried about. ; Therapist: How much do you believe, believe that thought then? ; Patient: I want to feel really confident in that moment. ; Patient: It feels very real. ; Patient: Like like any moment they're going to kick me out. ; Patient: Like I'm like, I'm just not doing well. ; Therapist: It's that bad. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Really intense. ; Therapist: So would you, would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what's true or not now or when you're in that state of anxiety? ; Patient: Definitely now. ; Patient: Now when that anxiety and that, you know, heart rate and sweating is not there. ; Therapist: So this evaluation, the percent that you believe that thought is true, this evaluation is more accurate? ; Patient: Yes, I think so. ; Therapist: And how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood you're in now where you can evaluate accurately? ; Patient: I would say, you know, when I'm not at risk of presenting, like I feel like I spend the majority of my time, like it's not something I worry about all the time just leading up to and then mostly that day. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So the, so you're able to evaluate the way you are now the vast majority of the time. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: There's a limited amount of time when you're not, when there's a lot of emotions going through. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And in those times you're maybe a little less reliable. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Like my judgment is clouded. ; Therapist: However in that moment you still, those beliefs are strong, right? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Buried. ; Therapist: And troubling. ; Therapist: Even though it's a small percentage, it's intense and you kind of carry that around with you a little bit. ; Patient: Yeah, exactly. ; Therapist: So I can see how this is frustrating for you. ; Patient: Right.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing okay. ; Therapist: Doing okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What's been going on? ; Patient: Well nothing too bad. ; Patient: I kind of got in a little bit of a bender bender accident. ; Therapist: A car accident? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What happened? ; Patient: Well, we were at a stop sign and there was one car here, another car here, and then I was here, another car was coming up behind me, and then they hit me and then I hit the car in front of me. ; Therapist: Oh. ; Patient: I kind of, you know, just the usual- Rock back and forth. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But other than that you're okay? ; Patient: No, they're- ; Patient: I got a couple, you know, little bruises from like hitting the steering wheel. ; Patient: I'm like, yeah, but I'm okay. ; Patient: My body's okay. ; Therapist: So physically you feel okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Were you like checked out by your physician or anything? ; Patient: Yeah, everything's okay here. ; Patient: I didn't break anything or pull anything or anything. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Emotionally? ; Patient: It's been kind of hard to like get in my car again afterwards. ; Patient: Like I've still been going to work and everything, but like I realized last night, like my boyfriend was like, oh, do you want to go on a trip this weekend? ; Patient: And I was kind of like, maybe not. ; Patient: Like I'm kind of like hesitant to get back in the car. ; Patient: So when he said that about the trip, what was the thought that came in your mind? ; Patient: I'm going to get hurt. ; Therapist: So it was really all about the car? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It wasn't anything else about the trip? ; Patient: No, it was being in the car, driving the car. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And your thought was you're going to get hurt? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I'm going to get hit, I'm going to get hurt. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any other areas that disrupted that trip? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you normally would have went on a trip? ; Patient: Oh, definitely. ; Patient: I was kind of excited about it. ; Patient: But now I'm just like, no, I don't know. ; Patient: Or even like coming here, I was like, well, maybe I can reschedule. ; Patient: Like I was just like, oh, I don't want to drive. ; Patient: I don't want to be behind the wheel. ; Patient: I don't want to drive. ; Patient: And like when I did drive, I was fine coming. ; Patient: Like I drove the way I normally do, but I was a little bit more aware. ; Patient: But I wasn't driving extra slow. ; Patient: I wasn't driving extra fast or anything. ; Patient: But like I was checking a lot more. ; Therapist: But very nervous. ; Patient: Much more nervous than usual. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: How did you feel about driving cars prior to this accident? ; Patient: I was fine. ; Patient: I mean, whenever like my friends would go anywhere, I would always volunteer to drive. ; Patient: Like I enjoyed driving. ; Patient: I liked listening to the radio. ; Patient: You know, I liked my family and I always went on trips. ; Patient: And like as soon as I turned 16, like I always had a turn. ; Patient: I enjoyed it. ; Patient: I liked going on drives, just looking around. ; Patient: But now I don't, too scared. ; Patient: It doesn't even come in my mind anymore as like a thing I would want to do. ; Patient: If I can avoid it, I will. ; Therapist: So you're taking every opportunity to avoid driving. ; Therapist: So far getting like here today and getting to work, essential functions you've been able to do. ; Patient: Yeah, it takes me a while to actually, like okay, like I have to. ; Patient: And then I just kind of do. ; Therapist: So what do you tell yourself to motivate yourself to get into the car? ; Therapist: Like to come here today for instance? ; Patient: Well, it takes me, I have to kind of think about it for a long time. ; Patient: But I mean, I'm very nervous. ; Patient: I mean, I don't, I can't really think of what I tell myself. ; Patient: It just kind of happens. ; Therapist: And when you get in the car, like when you kind of work past that nervousness to get in the car, how do you feel then? ; Patient: Still pretty scared. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm pretty scared throughout the whole thing. ; Patient: I'm, you know, I'm always worried that like if I can go away that I know that doesn't have any stop lights, I'll try to go that way. ; Patient: Even if it takes me an extra half hour. ; Therapist: Oh, that long. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, how about now? ; Therapist: Like you've driven here. ; Therapist: I presume you're going to drive your own car to wherever you're going next. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So does that kind of generate those same feelings and nervousness? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Like you just reminded me of that. ; Patient: Like, oh no. ; Therapist: You could feel it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So this is, this is disturbing for you. ; Therapist: This is painful for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's scary. ; Therapist: But it hasn't yet infringed on a crucial area of functioning like your job or something. ; Patient: Not yet. ; Therapist: But you're worried it might. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So prior to this car accident, how many car accidents have you been in? ; Patient: Maybe one small little thing, but this is the worst one I've been in. ; Therapist: The other one didn't bother you like this one did? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How long ago was the other one? ; Patient: Maybe like four or five years ago. ; Therapist: Were you hurting that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Were you driving? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So something about this one has triggered this nervousness. ; Therapist: The other one didn't. ; Therapist: What do you think is going on? ; Therapist: I don't know. ; Patient: This one it was different because I was by myself. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: It was rainy, so maybe that, it wasn't, and it wasn't the other before, but. ; Therapist: So it was raining in the recent accident. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And I was by myself, and then the other one I had somebody with me. ; Therapist: So this one maybe, I don't know. ; Therapist: Did the driver that hit you tell you what happened? ; Therapist: Like why they? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: They just, they kind of, they left pretty quickly afterwards actually, and I was just kind of left to deal with it. ; Therapist: Before the police got there? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Really? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So this really shook you up. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And your worries can interfere with other areas. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So your thinking is that you're going to get hurt, you're going to get hit if you get into a car again. ; Therapist: And you're thinking it before you get into a car and really. ; Patient: During, and even after it still kind of feels like, I don't know, even though I'm not in the car anymore I'm still like, kind of worried about it. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: And it's really worried about another accident. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So let's look at that. ; Therapist: You were wearing your seatbelt. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And you were driving, it was a little rainy. ; Therapist: Was it day or night? ; Patient: It was like five. ; Patient: It was getting ready to be dark but it wasn't dark yet. ; Patient: It wasn't dark, it was still daytime. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So what you're nervous about driving, I mean driving does carry risk. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So I can't tell you that there's a way to completely eliminate risk with driving a car. ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And you know this. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Having just been in an accident. ; Therapist: But there are certainly things you can do to minimize the risks. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: What do you think some of those things are you could do? ; Patient: Always wearing my seatbelt is pretty good. ; Therapist: Good idea. ; Patient: Well, I mean like I said, I try to go ways that don't have stop signs for stop lights, which is hard but... ; Therapist: That's difficult. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And I'm not sure that would really reduce the risk because you're driving longer. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So you'd have to look at that case by case. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But I see your point. ; Therapist: What else? ; Therapist: Oh, I don't know. ; Patient: Drive when there aren't cars around. ; Therapist: What's that? ; Patient: Drive when there aren't other cars around. ; Patient: Which again, probably is a good idea but it would be hard to practically implement, right? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because you're driving to work in rush hour and driving home in rush hour. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what about driving habits that you can use? ; Patient: Make sure I don't go too fast or too slow. ; Patient: Make sure that I have space around my car. ; Patient: Make sure all my lights are working, things like that. ; Patient: Make sure I don't have gas so I don't run out of gas or have to stop or something like that. ; Therapist: So follow all applicable traffic laws. ; Therapist: Keep aware of your environment. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: You can do things that will not eliminate but will reduce the risk of an accident. ; Therapist: Now you were hit while at a red light, right? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: That one, of course, the seat belt would be helpful. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Have a car that has airbags maybe? ; Therapist: Certainly the safety of your vehicle, right? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: A vehicle that's safer than average would be more ideal. ; Therapist: Ultimately, I think it's a good idea to be safe, to be aware, to do your best to minimize risk. ; Therapist: And at the same time recognize that you can't eliminate it. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So there's going to be a point where we have to really work through this nervousness. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's probably actually, I mean, in a way, you're looking around more. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But ultimately, it's probably going to hinder your life. ; Patient: Probably. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: Because you're restricting where you go and all that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And eventually, if it gets in the way of getting to work. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Or you might lose my job or my boyfriend wasn't very happy when I said I didn't want to go. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Yeah, so you don't want it to interfere anymore. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So what can you tell yourself? ; Therapist: We talked about automatic thoughts, right? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Like I'm going to get in an accident, which really that's one of the automatic thoughts. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: What are some of the adaptive responses that you could apply when that thought comes in? ; Therapist: Right, so the adaptive response is that self-talk, that message that you say to yourself. ; Therapist: What can you say to yourself? ; Patient: Like I'm doing everything I can to make sure that I'm safe. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Like I might not be able to prevent getting hit, but I can maybe, like at least maybe I will get hurt. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You can take every precaution. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Like it's going to be okay. ; Patient: Like I don't know. ; Patient: Like you're safe, you're okay, it's okay. ; Patient: Like okay, they stopped like just to try to, like if I see somebody coming behind me and they, I'm still worried about it, like noticing that they did stop and reassuring myself that it's going to be okay. ; Patient: Yeah, it's hard because it's still, you know, fresh. ; Therapist: Yeah, it's, yeah, thoughts are strong and you believe them and you believe that you're going to get hurt. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's very real to you. ; Therapist: And still there's always that possibility, so as I mentioned, you can't eliminate the ; Patient: risk. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So maybe one way to look at this is that you've only been in one other accident. ; Therapist: How many trips have you taken in your life in a car? ; Patient: Like a lot. ; Patient: I don't know, too many to count. ; Therapist: So it's, so the accidents are low probability events. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Scary, certainly, definitely not fun. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But they haven't happened too often considering the number of trips you've taken. ; Patient: That's true. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So another thing you could do is another adaptive response would be that I'm about to drive a car and there is an element of risk, but statistically. ; Patient: You probably won't get an accident compared to all the other times I've driven and not been in an accident. ; Therapist: Yeah, you probably won't. ; Patient: Yeah, that's true. ; Therapist: And you can reduce the risk by... ; Patient: Being careful. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, there's a part that you can, of this anxiety, I guess, that you can satisfy. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Meaning you could say, well, I can really reduce the risks and I know my chances are low in any particular one drive. ; Therapist: But there's another part of this that you, of this you kind of have to accept, which is you could be an accident. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And that's not what you want and you'll do your best to avoid it, but that could still happen. ; Therapist: Do you feel like, because I know this is all very fresh with the accident being recent, do you feel like you can apply those adaptive responses when you identify an automatic drop coming in? ; Patient: I can try. ; Patient: I mean, like I can think of the times where they've come into my head and they're like, oh, no. ; Patient: And then when I realize I'm getting ready to think that, I'll be like, well, actually, it's going to be okay. ; Patient: And I can try. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, I'd like to give you some homework. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Around this anxiety. ; Therapist: We talked about the thought record, which is like where you fill out the back thought and how much it distresses you. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: In this case, it might be good to know what it's preventing you from doing. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Because your thoughts actually stopping you from. ; Therapist: Yeah, going anywhere. ; Therapist: Part of the functioning. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And then you also put the adaptive response that you applied, like what you're able to ; Therapist: say to yourself. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then how you felt after that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, what we hope is by repeatedly using the thought record and applying the adaptive response, that we'll see improvement. ; Therapist: Because the way of measuring, it's therapeutic, but it's also a way of measuring how well you're dealing with it. ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, that's kind of, you know, there's the attacking that automatic thought, disputing that automatic thought piece to this. ; Therapist: And then there's kind of the acceptance piece of it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So, there's that low but definite probability of an accident. ; Therapist: You have to kind of accept that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: At some level. ; Therapist: And you have to pay with that. ; Therapist: And then the rest of it, you know, would be acknowledging that the probability is low, and that's good, and that you're likely not to get into an accident. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you feel like you can complete a few thought records between now and the next session? ; Patient: Yeah, I think so. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, let's do that. ; Therapist: If you feel like that's something you can be all right with. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Let's meet again in a week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And if you can have, say, two thought records. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, if that's two times and the thought came up, and then you've seen the thought record, you fill in each column. ; Therapist: And then we'll review that, and we'll see, you know, over the next few weeks if we can decrease these symptoms of nervousness and worry. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: That'd be good. ; Therapist: That'd be all right? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Thanks, Rebecca, and I'll see you in a week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Bye. ; Patient: Bye. ; Therapist: Bye.",

; Therapist: I wondered if we could spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight. ; Patient: You are joking aren't you? ; Patient: I mean look I've made time in my day to come here. ; Patient: I'm kept in your waiting room for 45 minutes. ; Patient: It's not acceptable. ; Patient: If I make an appointment with a client for 10 I expect them to start at 10 not quarter to 11. ; Therapist: Right and so you're busy enough. ; Patient: Yeah I've got other things to do. ; Patient: I've got counts to do. ; Patient: I've got clients that are coming in. ; Therapist: And it wasn't necessarily easy for you to make the time to come down and you had to wait in the waiting room and now I raise the subject of weight. ; Patient: Yeah I mean okay fair enough I've got to have my blood pressure medication change but I really haven't got time to talk about my weight. ; Patient: I mean you know I'm aware of my weight. ; Patient: I'm aware of the problems and I'm also aware of the solutions. ; Patient: So I don't really need a discussion. ; Patient: It's just I've got too much to do at the moment you know. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: It's been a bit of a rush for you coming in. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And I'm sorry about the weight in the waiting room. ; Patient: It's bad form you know. ; Therapist: Yeah that's not easy for you because you'd like to go really soon and here I am asking you to spend just a couple of minutes with me. ; Patient: Yeah but basically I've got things to do. ; Patient: I've got to get back to the office. ; Patient: I've got a pile of work that I've got to deal with. ; Patient: And every time every moment out of my day means I have to work in the evening or weekends. ; Therapist: It counts. ; Patient: Or when you're self-employed you haven't got a choice. ; Therapist: Exactly. ; Therapist: Exactly. ; Therapist: It's up to you. ; Therapist: Just a couple of minutes. ; Patient: Well I'm here now so yeah okay if it's a couple of minutes yeah. ; Therapist: I promise. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I really must get on. ; Therapist: I want to simply ask you how you feel about it. ; Patient: About what? ; Patient: Losing weight? ; Patient: Well obviously I want to. ; Patient: Yeah I mean who doesn't? ; Patient: I mean I'm aware that I'm over my balance weight but I know that it's causing problems. ; Patient: I mean obviously I get out of breath if I have to do something about how I realize that I'm on this blood pressure. ; Patient: And maybe that's probably contributing to it. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So you can see the links between your weight and your health and you'd like things to be a bit better. ; Patient: Yeah I mean there are other things but I mean yeah the weight is something I would like to get hold of. ; Patient: You'd get on, get on the handle. ; Therapist: You'd like to if you could. ; Patient: Yeah I mean I know the theories of a bit of exercise on a regular basis, a balanced diet but unfortunately because of my lifestyle, because of being self-employed as an accountant it's finding the time to exercise but also finding the time to sort of think okay I'm going to go shopping for this, that and the other. ; Patient: I'm going to prepare a meal. ; Patient: With me it's very often ready meals and that sort of thing. ; Patient: Yeah food on the run, you know, grazing. ; Therapist: Let me see if I can summarize what you've said and then we'll see what next. ; Therapist: You lead a busy life. ; Therapist: You run a business and you've got a lot to do. ; Therapist: You're aware of the links between your health and your weight and you are concerned to some extent about that and ideally it sounds like you'd like to do something about it. ; Therapist: It's just that your life is busy and rushed and you tend to use convenience foods in order to get the work done. ; Patient: Yeah I mean to a certain extent because of my lifestyle food is just fuel. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: You know because I'm juggling all these balls and I don't want to drop any. ; Therapist: I get it, I get it. ; Therapist: And so if you could fit it in you would like things to be different but that's not so easy. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Can I suggest that you come back and see me in a couple of weeks time just to chat about this? ; Patient: Okay, I'm up for that but it's going to be the same problem of A finding time and B if I make an appointment I don't expect to be kept waiting for half an hour or whatever because it's... ; Therapist: Exactly. ; Therapist: I'll tell you what might be a nice solution is if you come down first appointment and I give you an appointment at 8.30. ; Patient: That'd be good. ; Therapist: Then there'll be absolutely no waiting. ; Therapist: And the purpose of that visit will be to have a look at how you really feel about how you could move forward and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle into the busy work life that you've got. ; Patient: I'll maybe have a look at my schedules, see whether anything can be arranged or I can pass something on to some... ; Patient: And so it's not a wasted interview. ; Patient: So I can come here and say okay I've looked at my schedules, I've looked at things. ; Therapist: Good. ; Patient: Whatever. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: So give some thought to what we've talked about. ; Patient: Yeah, of course. ; Patient: Good stuff. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Okay, thanks. ; Patient: Sorry I went off a bit.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Kyle, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm doing alright. ; Patient: I'm not doing too bad. ; Patient: How are you Dr. Grande? ; Therapist: Not bad, thanks for asking. ; Therapist: What brings you in? ; Patient: So my girlfriend saw your ad in the paper and she saw out of some of the things that you work on, one of them is smoking cessation and it bothers her that I smoke. ; Patient: So she has been nagging me for like weeks to come in and talk to you. ; Patient: So I figured I would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it. ; Therapist: So you came into therapy today because your girlfriend pressured you? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean it's easier for me like if I come in here and talk to you, I can spend like 45 minutes with you compared to hours of her nagging me through the week. ; Therapist: So you weighed the cost benefit and decided to come in? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean it's covered by insurance, it's just 45 minutes of my time. ; Therapist: And what she would like you to do, and this is her goal, not yours, would be to stop smoking. ; Therapist: Tell me what your goal is. ; Patient: I mean I don't really have one. ; Patient: I don't think smoking is that bad. ; Patient: Well I mean I don't know, smoking could be bad but it's never bothered me. ; Patient: I don't know, I really don't have any goals to come in besides just having her stop bugging me. ; Therapist: So do you have a goal of quitting smoking? ; Patient: No, not at all. ; Patient: There's so many good things about smoking. ; Patient: What really got me into it was I smoke a lot at work because it gives me one-on-one time with the boss. ; Patient: So the fact that I can get that time with my boss is completely worth it. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about some of the other good things about smoking? ; Patient: It's just like, it's how I meet people. ; Patient: So like if I, I'll have cigarettes on me but I don't have a lighter and that kind of keeps me from finishing off a pack. ; Patient: Because I could finish off a pack a day. ; Patient: But if I don't have a lighter then I carry the cigarettes around with me and then if I see other people are smoking I can go and ask for a light. ; Patient: And that's always kind of like a way in to get to these groups. ; Patient: I've just met so many different people from smoking. ; Patient: So smoking, the way you're presenting it, has been a positive thing in your life? ; Patient: Yeah, I mean I only do it socially. ; Patient: So that's, yeah. ; Therapist: Are there any negative aspects to smoking? ; Patient: I mean yeah, I mean everyone knows smoking is unhealthy but like I don't, I don't smoke a lot. ; Patient: Like I only smoke from time to time and it's mostly just on the weekends. ; Patient: So it's like, I don't know, occasionally if I smoke over the weekends I might have like a cough maybe. ; Patient: Like a heavy cough on Mondays, Tuesdays, it's gone by Wednesdays so it's not really that big of a deal. ; Therapist: So you don't seem like you're too worried about the negative aspects. ; Patient: No, I mean like the, obviously it's unhealthy but like one of the things I'm trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people. ; Patient: And like the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than like giving it up for health reasons I think. ; Therapist: So let me ask you a question. ; Therapist: I want you to give me a response between one and ten. ; Therapist: This is called scaling. ; Therapist: And it's to do with the importance of stopping smoking. ; Therapist: So one would be it's not important to you and ten would be it's extremely important to you. ; Therapist: Where do you think you'd put that number? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Maybe like a two. ; Patient: Like it'd be cool to get rid of the cough on Mondays but that, getting rid of that is not worth everything else I get from smoking. ; Therapist: So not particularly important? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Now let me ask you the same question except instead of importance, how confident, we're talking about confidence, how confident are you that you could quit smoking? ; Therapist: On a scale of one to ten with one being not confident at all and ten being extremely confident. ; Patient: I could say probably like an eight or a nine. ; Patient: Like I could give it up. ; Patient: Actually I gave it up recently like for like a month and I didn't even crave it. ; Patient: But eventually like just seeing all my friends go out smoking, like I missed that so I just started up again. ; Patient: But I don't know. ; Patient: Like if I really wanted to give it up for good I'm sure I could. ; Therapist: So stopping smoking is not important to you but you're fairly confident you could if you decided to do it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn't seem like you're interested in stopping smoking, what would be a goal? ; Therapist: How could we spend this time so that it would be productive? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Like I guess it would help to be able to like explain to my girlfriend like the stuff that I get from smoking. ; Patient: And like you seem, you kind of seem like you get it. ; Patient: So like I don't know maybe figure out ways to like explain to her the things that I get from smoking to like I don't know just kind of help her like realize why I do it other than just to kill myself. ; Therapist: So to help her to understand why the smoking works for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So that's one goal. ; Therapist: Any other goals you could think of? ; Therapist: I mean you came in in part because, well it seemed like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So any other relational goals you might want to work on there? ; Patient: Um, I don't know. ; Patient: We haven't really been, like we've been fighting a lot because of the smoking. ; Patient: Um, so I think like maybe figuring out ways, I don't know, like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in a way. ; Patient: Like I don't know how to describe that but like having fights that are productive like that just don't always end like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us leaving the house. ; Patient: But like I guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doesn't last for like days. ; Therapist: So productive communication and productive arguments. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So she understands how important it is to you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because it does seem like it's really important to you. ; Therapist: But another would be to work on your relation, your relational style so that you can end the argument and feel like you're not a stalemate. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, I think that would be cool. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Well, you want to make those the goals we work on so we can spend this time productive fast? ; Patient: Yeah, I can deal with that. ; Patient: It's kind of like killing two birds with one stone. ; Therapist: Does that make sense to you? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, that's what we'll do. ; Therapist: So what I'd like you to do, I'll see you again in about a week. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So if you could reflect on some of these changes that you think you can make with this relationship, what you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator. ; Therapist: Because a lot of this revolves around communication, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Communicating the advantages of smoking but also communicating and the arguing so that you have a productive end to these arguments. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, that would be cool if we could do that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So if you could work on kind of thinking that through and then next time we meet we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes in that relationship to meet those goals. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Alright. ; Patient: Sounds good. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Thanks for coming in, Kyle. ; Patient: Yeah, thank you.",

Do you think that intergenerational contact is a good thing? ; Therapist: Very important. ; Patient: Why? ; Therapist: Because you, when you're busy bringing up children you haven't time to see the world ; Therapist: through their eyes or even really listen to them because you're too busy and preoccupied. ; Therapist: But then grandchildren come along and more importantly now great grandchildren and seeing the world fresh through these new eyes is just, it's quite mind blowing actually. ; Therapist: So I've learned a lot. ; Therapist: In the old days grandchildren used to learn at their grandparents knee. ; Therapist: But nowadays it's the grandparents learning at the grandchildren's knees now. ; Patient: Oh, do you think? ; Therapist: Definitely. ; Therapist: Oh yes. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Patient: And do you think that it also benefits them to spend time with people of different generations, different ages? ; Therapist: Well, as I said, they don't use age, you see, which is very releasing because, well, it just is, you know, after my generation, the way I was brought up to be seen and not heard and to sit in the parlour with all these old people. ; Therapist: And now, well, you're going around flipping parks, you know, the adventure things and they're saying, come on the slide with us and all this, you know, which I do. ; Therapist: Which I do. ; Therapist: I don't turn anything down. ; Therapist: That's the secret. ; Patient: Not turn anything down. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I say yes, yes. ; Patient: Good philosophy. ; Therapist: Except drugs. ; Therapist: Try everything once. ; Therapist: Try everything once. ; Patient: What's your view on nutrition and kind of, you know, having a so-called healthy diet? ; Therapist: I think the younger generation stress on it too much, far too much. ; Therapist: When you think that if my generation are living to be 100 and we were brought up with dripping sandwiches, meat with marbling in, etc, etc, full cream milk, all the rest of it, why get stressed out? ; Therapist: You know, just eat everything in moderation and enjoy life for goodness sake. ; Patient: I like that philosophy. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: How do you minimise the effects of stress? ; Patient: Do you have any, you know, did you have any techniques or if something stressful happens, is there anything particular that you do? ; Therapist: Gin and tonic or wine. ; Patient: Okay, yeah. ; Therapist: I've got a very good thing. ; Therapist: If I'm really cross with somebody and I'd really like to speak my mind to them, I'm very good at writing letters. ; Therapist: I don't send the letter to them, but I do write it down and get it out of my system and I keep it in a drawer in case one day I might need to plonk it down in front of them. ; Therapist: But it's, you know, it's off, it's out of my head. ; Therapist: And if I need to go to the doctor about anything, I will write down what I want to say to him because I don't believe they listen to you all the time, especially a woman, if it's a man doctor. ; Therapist: Well, you know, it's her, they think, oh God, it's her again, you know? ; Therapist: So I think, put this down and smile at him. ; Therapist: He's got to read it. ; Patient: I think you're in your seventies now. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Do you enjoy being in your seventies? ; Patient: What was your favourite period of, you know, in life? ; Patient: If you can, if there's an answer to that. ; Therapist: No there isn't. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: You should just enjoy every day as it comes and not get hung up about age. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because I'm surrounded by 90 year olds now and honestly, they're like nine years old. ; Therapist: We have the biggest laughs and they do the silliest things and you know, we feel as if we've been set free from actual age, you know, you're a mother, set an example to the children or you're a daughter, you know. ; Patient: So do you think it makes a difference, kind of moving on from those responsibilities, kind of times of life? ; Patient: So when you are looking after your children, is that what you mean by you feel a sense of relief later? ; Therapist: Yes, because you're not, no one's judging you, except that you're hanging around too long. ; Therapist: But apart from that, no, it's good. ; Therapist: I mean, I was brought up by a Victorian father who was a bank manager and it was always, just remember who I am in this town. ; Therapist: You know, they were somebody in those days. ; Therapist: You're my children. ; Therapist: And then I went to a convent grammar. ; Therapist: Just remember who you are, girls. ; Therapist: You're a convent grammar school girl. ; Therapist: You know, so it didn't leave much to sin, did it? ; Therapist: It didn't leave much to... ; Patient: It's a pressure to... ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So yeah, there's all these pressures as you're going through life. ; Therapist: So it's nice to be. ; Therapist: My husband died in his 50s, so I had to reinvent myself, which was scary, very scary after being a wife and mother all those years. ; Therapist: But my goodness me. ; Patient: I think it was either earlier this year or last year you did something quite big for a stranger? ; Therapist: Oh, the kidney donation, yes, in February. ; Therapist: February this year? ; Therapist: Yes. ; Patient: You donated a kidney to a stranger? ; Therapist: Yeah, a gentleman, I believe. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: How did you decide to do that or find out about that and then decide? ; Therapist: I found out on Facebook. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Don't ask me what the heading was, but I'm already, like most people, donated after death, you know, everything. ; Therapist: I mean, I'm leaving my body to leave medical school as well, which hasn't pleased one of my daughters, but there you go. ; Therapist: How can we grieve if you're still hanging around? ; Therapist: She said, so, so yes. ; Therapist: So some of them were for it and some of them weren't. ; Patient: And going through the transplant, the operation, it's quite a big thing to go through. ; Therapist: Well, I think all last year I was doing tests, you know, everything from psychological tests to all the physical tests and brain scans and everything scanned. ; Therapist: It was better than a thousand mile service and I thought, well, I'm doing this for the right reasons, I know that, but who knows? ; Therapist: They might find something totally wrong with me and that's the way I found out. ; Therapist: So it's a win-win situation, I believe. ; Therapist: And you know that if they do accept you, and I was the oldest one that they've ever had, they said, and it'll last 20 years, apparently, a kidney can last 20 years. ; Therapist: That was good. ; Therapist: So it's a win-win. ; Patient: I think I've asked most things on my list that I wanted to talk about. ; Patient: Is there anything that you think that I've missed that is worth covering in terms of the theme of living well for longer? ; Therapist: Well, I think if you can do something for somebody else, for whatever reason, however tiny, the comeback to yourself is just huge. ; Therapist: But as long as you don't look for that comeback, but it just is. ; Therapist: And it also consolidates the reason why you're still alive, that you're not just taking up space on the planet, and that you should do something, like in January, hopefully, tandem parachute jump for Alzheimer's. ; Patient: Oh, is that the plan? ; Therapist: That's the plan when I'm 80. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: To raise money for Alzheimer's. ; Therapist: For Alzheimer's. ; Patient: Tandem jump out of the plane. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: Wow. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's really good. ; Patient: Is there any advice that you would give to yourself, age 20, or any of our students? ; Therapist: Not to have taken life so seriously. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Well, one, you don't know how long you're here for. ; Therapist: And two, nobody's that important. ; Therapist: You know, you're not the centre of the universe, for goodness sake. ; Therapist: So just get on with things. ; Therapist: It's like, I feel sorry with Facebook, you know, if they don't get enough likes. ; Therapist: You know, it must ruin the day, some people. ; Therapist: Well, this is all false. ; Therapist: It's all smoke and murder. ; Therapist: One thing a friend did say to me that was very important, and I very proudly was saying that I now owned my own house, you see. ; Therapist: And she just laughed and she said, do you think you'd, really? ; Therapist: I went, yes, you know. ; Therapist: Oh, you're taking it with you, are you? ; Therapist: She said, you don't own anything, she said. ; Therapist: Smoke and mirrors, all of it. ; Therapist: And it's true, isn't it? ; Therapist: So just laugh and get on with it. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, Sasha. ; Therapist: How you doing today? ; Patient: I'm all right, thanks. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing okay. ; Therapist: Thank you for asking. ; Therapist: I understand that you've been having some difficulty with some symptoms. ; Therapist: Is that right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about what's been going on? ; Patient: Yeah, for the past maybe couple weeks, I guess, few weeks, I have these morning meetings once a week at work and I have to make a presentation. ; Patient: And every time I go to present, it's my turn and I start getting really nervous. ; Therapist: Start getting really nervous. ; Therapist: So, morning meeting at work and so does each person at the meeting present in a row? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: We all take turns. ; Therapist: You all take turns. ; Therapist: And when you start to feel nervous when it's your time to talk or before or after that? ; Patient: No, usually the kind at the start of the meeting because I know I'm going to have to. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: There's about 10 of us and I always seem to be one of the last few to go like six or seven kind of in line to present. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, there's around 10 people at the meeting? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And as luck would have it, you tend to be toward the end. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, can you describe what's happening, let's say, from the beginning of the meeting in terms of what you're experiencing? ; Patient: So, when I walk in, I'm usually okay and say good morning to everybody and then my boss calls me to order and that's usually when it starts. ; Patient: It kind of starts like maybe like butterflies in my stomach kind of. ; Patient: And then after he makes his report and then it just starts going around the room and my heart starts to beat faster, my palms get sweaty and I just start to feel really nervous. ; Patient: I've realized that I might be, I kind of, I start to tune out some of the other presentations because I start to become focused on how I'm ; Patient: feeling. ; Therapist: So, you're focused on the physical sensation of being nervous and the mental sensation and you're not really hearing what they're saying? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Is that what they're saying? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, go on. ; Therapist: So, you have these physical symptoms, this nervousness, what happens then? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: By the time it's my turn to present, I start, I just, I'm almost like just almost shaking. ; Patient: I notice that my hands are a little off and so I'll keep my hands down like in my lap and just so that I don't want anybody to see them shaking like that. ; Patient: I have a paper in front of me that I just kind of read from but when I start reading, my voice is a little shaky and I kind of stutter and trip over my words and I just, I feel like I'm not making good presentations and that it's not looking good to my boss. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, in the moment when it's your turn to present, you're still feeling that same nervousness like that doesn't go away at all. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And you're trying to hold your body kind of still like almost like keep control. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And then your voice is kind of, sounds like crackly or breaking up as you're trying to present like bullet points like on a... ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Like an outline. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: What happens when you have read the last point? ; Patient: Well, when I'm done, it takes a little bit for everything to calm down but then I'm consumed by the idea that my boss thinks I did a terrible job and that he's regretting putting me in this position and that I can't make good reports or that I didn't report the right stuff, the right information to him and so it doesn't really go away. ; Patient: It's almost like my mind just shifts on what I'm anxious about. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, the nervousness, that stronger feeling of nervousness, that goes away. ; Therapist: It's replaced by a more general feeling of nervousness about how your boss will think of you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because of the presentation quality. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Because as you're presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling, he's picking up on that and you're aware of that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How long have you noticed these symptoms that appear in this way? ; Patient: You know, when I was an undergrad in college, I had to make some presentations from time to time and I would get nervous when I would make the presentations and I just, maybe most people are afraid of public speaking so I kind of thought that maybe that's what it was, you know, just doing a presentation in front of like 30 something people and so it didn't really bother me then. ; Patient: I figured it was just normal and I always got decent grades on my presentation so it never really bothered me. ; Patient: So I really feel like it's only been an issue in the last few weeks. ; Therapist: The last few weeks is when you noticed this. ; Therapist: You had some nervousness before presenting. ; Therapist: You were in college but you just kind of thought of it as normal. ; Therapist: It didn't really impair your ability to present. ; Therapist: It didn't affect your grades or anything. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to what's going on? ; Patient: I'm not sure if it has any bearing. ; Patient: My mom, she doesn't like to speak in public. ; Patient: I know I used to talk to her about how I feel nervous about making presentations in school and she would say, oh, you come by as honest honey ,and so I don't know if that means anything. ; Therapist: So whatever you have going on, you think that maybe she has that going on too. ; Patient: Maybe. ; Therapist: The same set of symptoms at least. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean I've asked her, I've told her about this and she hasn't been in a situation where she's had to do this kind of presentations like in a small group like this and so I can't compare it to that but I mean she has said that she's gotten nervous before. ; Therapist: Any feelings of sadness or anything like that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Like after I make the presentation at work and then I do start feeling really sad, like I said, because then I feel like my boss isn't satisfied with my performance and that he's going to regret his decision to give me this position and so yeah, it definitely makes me sad. ; Patient: I feel disappointed in myself. ; Therapist: Do you have any substance use going on, alcohol, anything else? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I have a drink every now and then. ; Patient: It's very, very rare. ; Therapist: I know this is something recent for you but in these meetings so far, has the nervousness ever caused you to leave the room before they came around to your turn? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I've managed to control it I guess to where I can stay there. ; Patient: Like I said, I've zoned out sometimes when other people have been presenting and I feel bad about that too because I feel like they have important information to share with me and I should give them the same respect of paying attention but I become focused on what's going on inside like my heart beating and my hands and so I zone out on them sometimes but no, I push through it and I do my presentation. ; Therapist: Are you ever worried about what they're thinking about? ; Therapist: You mentioned what your boss could be thinking about you. ; Therapist: Have you ever worried about what the other workers at the table are thinking about you? ; Patient: Yeah, sometimes because I feel like I'm the newest member of the management team and so I feel like they're kind of like, what is up with this chick? ; Patient: Why can't she get it together? ; Patient: But there's been one person who's been really supportive and she's been like, hey, you did great today and great information and things like that so that kind of helps me feel better but I guess at the end of the day to me, it's really my boss's opinion that matters because he's my boss. ; Therapist: Have you ever felt, you mentioned you were nervous at the beginning of the meeting. ; Therapist: Have you ever felt nervous well in advance of the meeting? ; Patient: When I'm preparing like that morning to go to work and it's one of those like, okay, I got this meeting at nine and I start to think about it like on my way into work but I don't start feeling anything until I'm actually in the room. ; Therapist: Alright, so you have this nervousness, it's fairly intense, pretty much only at these meetings. ; Therapist: It's been bothering you for a few weeks. ; Therapist: Something new, something a little frightening for you. ; Therapist: Alright, we'll get you set up with treatment. ; Therapist: I'll get you in to see somebody in the next few days if that works for you. ; Patient: Yeah, that'd be great. ; Therapist: And I appreciate you spending this time with me. ; Therapist: It's been helpful. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Thanks, Sasha.",

; Patient: I'm sorry I might be wasting your time a bit but I've come because I'm not sleeping very well. ; Patient: I'm just exhausted and I just wondered if you could give me something, anything to help me sleep, some sleeping tablets. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: It would really help me if I could ask a few more questions about how you're feeling and some of your symptoms and then we can sort of see how I can help you. ; Therapist: Would that be okay? ; Patient: Yeah, that's fine. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: So why don't you tell me a bit more about what's brought you here today? ; Patient: About a year ago my husband was split up and since then I've just not been coping very much. ; Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. ; Patient: I'm just tired all the time and the kids and the job and I just don't feel like managing very well. ; Patient: I can't sleep. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Well, why don't we just look at one of those things at a time? ; Therapist: Tell me a bit more about, um, you say having trouble sleeping. ; Patient: I just lie awake at night. ; Patient: I don't know what time it is, but just seems to go on and on and on the night. ; Patient: I know I must've got sleep in the morning. ; Patient: I just feel so dreadful. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And you having problems with your appetite? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I make the kids to dinner, but I just can't be bothered. ; Patient: Not bothered at all about it. ; Therapist: And what about sort of life in general? ; Therapist: Have you kind of lost your get up and go? ; Patient: Sorry, I don't understand. ; Therapist: You get up and go, your energy levels, have you found that they're kind of low? ; Patient: Um, yeah, I used to enjoy swimming with the kids and stuff, but I just want to be on my own. ; Patient: I just can't be bothered. ; Patient: I just, I'm just not been a very good mum at the moment as well. ; Patient: I just so exhausted really. ; Therapist: Can you just going back to your sleep, can you tell me a bit more about that? ; Therapist: How much sleep you're getting each night? ; Patient: I just lie awake and just think about him and her together, things that we used to do. ; Patient: I just wake up exhausted. ; Therapist: Sounds like your lack of energy and lack of sleep and lack of appetite. ; Therapist: It seems to me that things seem to be really getting you down. ; Patient: I'm just such a mess at the moment. ; Patient: I'm just not coping, I'm just exhausted. ; Therapist: You say you're a mess. ; Patient: Well, look at me. ; Patient: I just, you know, I just need some sleep. ; Therapist: It would be helpful for me just to sort of find out a bit more about home life and work life and ask a few questions in that area. ; Therapist: Would that be okay? ; Patient: Yeah, it's fine. ; Patient: Sorry. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, so do you work? ; Patient: Um, I work in a job centre. ; Patient: It gets a bit stressful at times. ; Patient: Um, we've got to see so many people. ; Patient: Of course they're stressed. ; Therapist: Um, I've got some patients who work in the same environment. ; Therapist: It's very high pressure, isn't it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Um, someone is, I just can't be bothered to get out of bed and um, it's um, that's worrying me because I've fallen sick and you know, it's not good to have a sick record, is it? ; Patient: It's not like me. ; Therapist: And who else is at home with you? ; Patient: I've got two kids. ; Patient: Um, one's one girl, one boy. ; Patient: Richard is the youngest. ; Patient: He's seven. ; Patient: Anne-Marie, she's nine. ; Therapist: Do they get to their father much? ; Patient: Um, no, he can't be bothered now. ; Patient: He's got a new family. ; Patient: He doesn't see them at all. ; Patient: They're very good kids. ; Therapist: It must be quite hard on both you and them. ; Patient: I try and be a good mum but it's very difficult. ; Therapist: Do you get any help or support from anyone else? ; Patient: My mum, she's wonderful but she has arthritis. ; Patient: So she, you know, she does what she can. ; Therapist: Does she live locally? ; Patient: Yeah, she's just around the corner and she picks the kids up from school. ; Patient: And um, yeah, she's an angel. ; Patient: She helps me a lot. ; Therapist: What about you? ; Therapist: What about your hobbies and things you enjoy doing? ; Patient: I used to enjoy going to the cinema with my friends. ; Patient: Even line dancing, we used to go down to the village for line dancing. ; Patient: But that's been a while ago. ; Patient: I just, nobody wants a bit of misery around, do they? ; Patient: And I'd rather be on my own now. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Well, I know you've, you're not a doctor and, but you must have had thoughts about what's causing all these feelings. ; Therapist: Um, had you thought about, about these, those type of things? ; Patient: I guess I was on automatic pilot when he first left. ; Patient: I guess that's why I'm in the state I am now. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Could I resent the kids? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: But I suppose that's why I keep going down and I just feel everything's useless. ; Patient: I can't sleep, you know. ; Therapist: What tends to bother you the most? ; Therapist: Is it the sleep or the, your appetite or the energy or not coping with the kids? ; Patient: Sleep, I just feel if I had a bit more energy, if I could just have something just to, you know, help me out with them so I can do the normal things. ; Therapist: That was going to be really what I was going to ask next. ; Therapist: I mean, what, what were your thoughts about how he could help you today? ; Patient: Well, I just thought with, with one of these other things, but sleeping tablets, I thought they might help. ; Therapist: Would it be a good idea perhaps if we think about all the options and available to you and then decide which, which ones may be best for you? ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: What, what, what are the other options? ; Therapist: Well, you might have heard of some of the, the talking therapies, um, being able to sit down and talk with a sort of a trained counsellor about, about your feelings and about what's been happening. ; Patient: People that help my sleep, will that make me be able to cope the next day through sleep? ; Therapist: It may help you deal with some of your feelings. ; Therapist: Um, I take on board about the thought about using a sleeping tablet. ; Therapist: I think that could be another option. ; Therapist: Um, obviously one of the concerns we have is that we don't want to have you on sleeping tablets for a long period of time because there are issues about becoming dependent on them and reliant on them. ; Therapist: We can use them for a short period of time, say for a week to help you get back into a bit more of a normal sleep pattern. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Um, that sounds good. ; Therapist: I mean, what about those two options as the option, the counsellor or perhaps trying to short course of sleeping? ; Patient: She had counselling. ; Patient: She had counselling. ; Patient: Um, I'd like, I mean, I just feel if I had some sleeping tablets, that might just, just give me a spur really. ; Patient: And, and, and, and I'm quite happy with the counselling as well. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So you'd like to try both. ; Therapist: Um, I think that, that, that, that sounds a good idea. ; Therapist: Uh, would you be happy to the counsellor here at the surgery? ; Patient: Yes, that'd be fine. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I can organise that. ; Therapist: I can speak to her and ask her to contact you to make an appointment. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Um, it'd also be really helpful for me as well if you could complete, uh, one of our HADS questionnaires. ; Patient: What's, what's a HADS, what's a question, HADS questionnaire? ; Therapist: Uh, sorry. ; Therapist: It's a short questionnaire. ; Therapist: Just, um, asking some questions about your feelings and it'll help me to find out, um, if there's any more help I can give you when I next see you. ; Therapist: Is that okay? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: From what you've told me today, I mean, it sounds ready for the last 12 months or so you felt really low since split from your husband. ; Therapist: Your sleep's not been good. ; Therapist: Your appetite's not been good. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I'm a mess. ; Therapist: Um, it sounds to me your self esteem's taken a real knock, hasn't it? ; Therapist: Um, I certainly think the help we can give you with some counselling, which we have a counsellor that comes here in the surgery that will be, I think will be a benefit to you. ; Therapist: And then we'll try this short course of a sleeping tablet to try and get you back into a sleep pattern. ; Therapist: And then maybe I can see you in about two, three weeks time. ; Therapist: And I don't want you to think that you have to sort of manage all this by yourself. ; Therapist: I mean, that's why we're here. ; Therapist: We're here to help and support you further. ; Therapist: Let me do the prescription then. ; Therapist: It's 12 Hadfield Close. ; Patient: Yep. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So that's gone to reception now so you can put that up on the way out. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And um, I'll give you one of the Had's questionnaires as well. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Complete that before we see you next time. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Thank you doctor. ; Patient: Thank you for that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: See you next time. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Bye bye.",

; Therapist: How much are you drinking now? ; Patient: I go out with my friends a couple nights a week, and then about once a week I'll go out with my co-workers. ; Patient: So, yeah, maybe three, four nights a week. ; Therapist: Three or four nights a week you're drinking? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how much are you drinking each time you go out? ; Patient: It kind of depends on who I'm with, but usually when I go out with my friends on the weekend I'll stay for a pretty long time. ; Patient: I mean, I think the problem is when I'm going out during the week with my co-workers, I'll stay longer than I want to, and then when I have to get up in the morning it's kind of like, ugh, I should have gone home a little earlier. ; Patient: But, no, they're all out with me, so when I get there they understand. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So do you know how much alcohol, like you were talking about the time period, do you know how much you're actually drinking each night approximately? ; Patient: Well, before I used to drink maybe two beers an hour, but they really like to party, so, and I'm trying to keep up with them, so ; Therapist: You're friends? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: So I've been drinking a shot with the beers I have, so maybe like three or four drinks an hour. ; Therapist: Do you find that you need to drink more to get the desired effect? ; Patient: Yeah, you know, everyone else is getting to that level, so I feel like I need to keep up with them, and usually before I would get that from maybe one or two drinks, so now I've been drinking a little bit more, I think, to get there. ; Therapist: Have you made any attempts to cut down on the consumption? ; Patient: You know, at the beginning of the week I would kind of say, you know, I'm only going to go out twice this week. ; Patient: But then they invite me and I'm kind of like, oh, well, I don't want to miss out, they're my friends, you know. ; Patient: This might show my social time during the week, so I usually go. ; Patient: I don't really stick to the plan. ; Patient: So that's kind of been a little frustrating, but I don't know, I still think it's okay. ; Therapist: So I want to talk about the time you spent using alcohol. ; Therapist: Are you okay with the amount of time? ; Therapist: You mentioned that you're using it for a longer period, but are you okay with that? ; Therapist: Or is that something that's distressing you? ; Patient: You know, I think I could probably be doing better things with my time, but this is not a huge problem. ; Patient: I think a lot of people do it, so, you know. ; Therapist: Do you find that you have a craving for alcohol? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Tell me about that. ; Patient: I would say, like, when I'm at work, I'm just ready to get finished so I can go to happy hour with my co-workers, or, you know, if I'm just kind of at a barbecue or something with family, think about how I want a beer. ; Patient: So, yeah, I have cravings, but, you know, everyone kind of does that, like, oh, I could go for a beer right now. ; Therapist: So you're thinking about it, but you're also feeling the craving? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You mentioned work. ; Therapist: Are you having trouble with responsibilities at work or any other area? ; Patient: No, my work life has been pretty, going pretty well. ; Patient: I haven't missed work because of it or anything like that, so. ; Therapist: Because of the drinking? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: How about any social problems due to the alcohol? ; Patient: No, I think my social life is actually great because of it, you know, hanging out with my friends and we all get along really well, so, yeah, it's my social time. ; Therapist: All right, so no social problems? ; Patient: No, no problems. ; Therapist: Have you had to give up any important activities because of the alcohol use? ; Patient: Important activities, well, usually the important activities involve drinking, so. ; Patient: I haven't given up important activities that don't involve drinking, but that's been pretty easy because there's usually alcohol at the important things, so. ; Therapist: I see you haven't missed any important activities because of that. ; Therapist: How about engaging in any activities that are physically dangerous because alcohol is involved? ; Patient: No, no, I'm usually pretty safe, yeah. ; Therapist: Safe? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you have any medical or mental health history? ; Patient: Well, like when I was a kid I was diagnosed with, I think, maybe ADHD or something like that, but I think my teachers were annoyed by me because I just like to have a good time, so. ; Patient: But that's not really been an issue lately. ; Therapist: That's not been an issue? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Has any medical problem or mental health problem become worse because of the alcohol? ; Patient: No, you know, I started drinking after that, so. ; Patient: No, it's not become an issue with it. ; Therapist: So you mentioned alcohol use. ; Therapist: Has there been any drug use? ; Patient: No, not with my drinking or anything. ; Patient: You know, typical teenage smoking marijuana and stuff when I was younger, but I don't anymore, so. ; Therapist: So it's just alcohol now? ; Patient: Yeah, just alcohol. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do you have, when you stop drinking, do you have any physical symptoms or anxiety, any symptoms of withdrawal? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I usually feel fine afterwards. ; Patient: I can go a few days without drinking. ; Therapist: Okay, so that's not a problem for you? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Jackie, are you open to receiving counseling services or agency? ; Patient: Yeah, I don't see why it would hurt anything. ; Patient: I don't really know if I need it, but. ; Therapist: But you'll be okay with trying? ; Patient: Yeah, I think it would be okay. ; Therapist: Alright, I'm going to get you scheduled in to see a counselor. ; Therapist: I want to thank you for telling me about what's going on and for answering my questions. ; Therapist: It's been helpful. ; Patient: Yeah, sure. ; Patient: Yeah, thank you.",

; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: What's been going on? ; Patient: So I've been made to come in and talk to you because something happened on the bus and I might have said something to somebody and they're just like, oh you can't say that. ; Patient: So they actually said, Doug, we're going to take you to jail. ; Patient: From jail they just called me here. ; Therapist: Do you know what you're charged with? ; Patient: They didn't explain anything. ; Patient: The government never explains anything. ; Patient: They just don't want me to understand what's going on because they just want to keep me held in captivity. ; Therapist: The government? ; Therapist: Do you have anybody specific? ; Patient: No, it's the entire government. ; Therapist: The entire government? ; Patient: The entire government. ; Therapist: And how long have they been wanting to do this to you? ; Patient: All my life. ; Patient: They've done this all my life. ; Patient: They're always listening, they're always around, they're always there. ; Therapist: Always there? ; Patient: Always there. ; Patient: Like for example, they're in the lights right now. ; Patient: They're listening to everything that we're talking about so that's the reason why I really want to talk about what happened on the bus because they're just going to use that again today and then it's going to lock me up again and make me take more minutes. ; Therapist: You've been taking medications? ; Patient: Yes, I take the medication because if I don't take the medication, the government comes and takes me away and puts me into a hospital where they force feed me the medication and then the lights are always on and they can always hear everything that I'm saying and what I'm thinking and what I'm going to do. ; Therapist: Do you know what they want to do with that information? ; Patient: They want to use it to take over the world. ; Therapist: To take over the world? ; Patient: To take over the world, of course. ; Patient: They want to use everything and use everything that everybody knows to use it against them so that they can actually have the world that they want and that they need and make everybody pretend that they don't know what's going on. ; Patient: So therefore they're using everybody's thoughts against themselves so that the government can use it to their benefit. ; Therapist: So what can you do in this situation? ; Patient: What do you mean? ; Patient: What can I do? ; Therapist: Well, you said the government's monitoring everything and that they want to put you in jail. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: If you don't take your medication, do you have any options? ; Therapist: Are you stuck? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: When I'm home, I think I'm perfectly fine because I set up my house and my room to actually make it government-approved so that nobody can actually hear or see what's going on in there. ; Patient: So when I'm home, I'm perfectly fine. ; Therapist: So one option is that being home. ; Patient: Being home, you're safe. ; Patient: Being home, I'm safe. ; Patient: Being home, I'm safe. ; Patient: My mom's safe. ; Patient: My brother's safe. ; Patient: Everybody's safe. ; Patient: And being out in the world, I'm not safe. ; Patient: Nobody's safe. ; Therapist: Are you safe here? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I told you they are in the light and they can hear everything that we're saying right now. ; Patient: So no, we're not safe here. ; Therapist: So it's not safe here. ; Therapist: It's not safe out in the world. ; Therapist: At home, you're safe. ; Patient: At home, I'm safe in my room that I made government-approved. ; Therapist: So if you could have your way, you would just stay home most of the time, all the time? ; Patient: I would stay home all of the time, but I can't stay home because I need to go and see doctors. ; Patient: And talk to people and do things that the government needs me or wants me to do. ; Patient: But I don't want to do those things because it's using my thoughts and they're trying to use everybody against me. ; Patient: And I just can't deal with that. ; Therapist: So how do you know that they're in the lights? ; Therapist: How did you discover that? ; Patient: Everybody knows that they're in the lights. ; Therapist: It's common knowledge? ; Patient: It's common knowledge. ; Therapist: Do you ever hear things that other people can't hear or see things that other people can't see? ; Patient: No, of course. ; Patient: Everybody hears the lights talking to you. ; Patient: I don't know what you're talking about. ; Patient: Like, everybody hears it. ; Patient: Sometimes it's a whisper for some people. ; Patient: Sometimes it's a yell. ; Patient: And if you want to not pay attention to what the lights are saying to you, then I don't know what's wrong with you, but everybody can hear it. ; Therapist: Everybody can hear it? ; Patient: Everybody can. ; Therapist: What's it sound like to you? ; Patient: It just sounds like a robot talking. ; Patient: It sounds like we need to know this information. ; Patient: We need to... ; Patient: What are you doing? ; Therapist: Oh, just making some notes. ; Therapist: Just making some progress notes. ; Therapist: Is it working? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: Where are your notes going to go? ; Therapist: Well, this chart will get locked in the chart room down the hall. ; Patient: Who has access to the chart room? ; Therapist: Mostly everybody works here. ; Patient: Oh. ; Patient: Can I get a copy of your notes after you're done? ; Therapist: Does it worry that there's notes? ; Patient: Yes, because I might trust you, and I don't know if I do yet, but I don't trust the other people who work here because I don't know if they're working for the government, which they probably are working for the government. ; Patient: So they can actually have access to all of my notes and the things that you're writing down, which I don't know what they are because you're not going to get me a copy of it yet. ; Patient: And I just don't trust that they can actually get that information in because they're going to use it to their advantage, and they're going to give it to the government, which I can't have that happening. ; Patient: So could you please not take notes? ; Therapist: I can not take notes. ; Therapist: What kind of information and notes are you worried that the government's going to get? ; Patient: Well, because I made my room at home government-proof, I think they're going to get a copy of my notes and I'm going to try to steal that technology that I actually created so that they can then disrupt my room and then everybody else's rooms who are just like mine so that they can then use their mind control to then control me to do the things that they want me to do. ; Therapist: So without the protection that your house offers, they could control your mind? ; Patient: Correct. ; Patient: Without my room and without the technology and the systems and the things that I created, then the government will be able to control everything that I do. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So can you tell me about your mood through all this? ; Therapist: So this sounds really stressful. ; Therapist: You're describing an environment where the government's frequently looking at what you're doing. ; Therapist: What are the feelings there? ; Therapist: Do you feel sad or angry? ; Patient: I feel fine. ; Therapist: You feel fine? ; Patient: I feel fine. ; Patient: I don't really have – yeah, I just feel fine. ; Patient: I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad. ; Patient: I just – I'm just here. ; Therapist: Kind of resigned that the government's going to do this? ; Patient: Well, the government's going to do what they're going to do anyway, so it doesn't matter if I'm happy, sad, pissed off, angry, any of that. ; Patient: The government's going to make me do what they want me to do anyway, so it doesn't matter how I feel. ; Therapist: Are you worried that something is going to happen that's similar to what happened on the bus? ; Patient: No, because I've learned my lesson to not say those things out loud and to talk about what the government's doing because I can't actually inform anybody else because nobody's listening to me because they're already controlled by the government because they don't have a room like I do at home. ; Therapist: So you avoid that in the future because it didn't really work? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: You weren't able to help them understand what's going on? ; Patient: Well, if people don't understand what's going on, then that's their fault and that's their problem. ; Patient: They should have listened to me. ; Patient: I could have actually gave them the technology that they needed to actually create the room so that the government can't hear them. ; Therapist: But they weren't open to that idea? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Quite the opposite. ; Patient: Completely the opposite. ; Therapist: How are your family relationships? ; Therapist: How's that going? ; Patient: They're okay. ; Patient: I live with my mom. ; Patient: She does what she's supposed to. ; Patient: She doesn't go in my room because she knows that if she goes into the room, it's going to mess up the technology so she stays out. ; Therapist: So you get along with her okay? ; Patient: We're fine. ; Therapist: Anybody else you have contact with? ; Therapist: Friends, family? ; Patient: No, just I talk to people all the time but they're just in my head. ; Patient: We have conversations all the time about how we can actually make the world a better place and then how we can actually go through and then destroy the government. ; Patient: But yeah, I just talk to them in my head. ; Therapist: Alright Jason, I'm sorry to hear that you're under stress. ; Therapist: I'm glad to hear you feel like your mood's okay if you're not down or anxious or anything. ; Therapist: This, answering these questions for me, this has been helpful and I'm going to recommend you continue to see a counselor here if that's okay. ; Therapist: I realize you're court ordered. ; Patient: Can this counselor be you? ; Therapist: It could be me. ; Therapist: Would that make you feel more comfortable? ; Patient: That would make me feel much better. ; Therapist: Well then I'll put on the schedule, we'll set a time up front where I'll see you, let's say in three days. ; Therapist: That works? ; Patient: Three days works. ; Therapist: And we'll go from there. ; Therapist: Thanks Jason.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Lisa, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm well, how are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well, thanks for asking. ; Therapist: It's nice to meet you, I'm glad you could come in to the agency. ; Therapist: Could you tell me what brings you here today? ; Patient: Um, well, I am here now because I was caught stealing money. ; Patient: And now I have to pay the price I guess. ; Therapist: Alright, so were you ordered by a court? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How long ago did the crime occur? ; Patient: About a month ago. ; Therapist: About a month ago? ; Therapist: So I'm going to try to get an idea of what's going on with you to see where you fit in in terms of treatment. ; Therapist: So it's an assessment, so I'll be asking you some questions about your history and things that you've done, any feelings you've had, thoughts you've had. ; Patient: Like diagnosing? ; Therapist: Like diagnosing. ; Therapist: Is that okay with you? ; Patient: Sure. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So how old are you now? ; Patient: 25 ; Therapist: 25? ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So you say about a month ago you got in some trouble, can you tell me what happened there? ; Patient: Um, well I stole money from a friend of mine and you know, I just needed the money. ; Patient: They had more money than me so I took it. ; Therapist: So you needed the money? ; Patient: Mm hmm. ; Therapist: And this was a friend of yours? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How do things stand between you and your friend now? ; Patient: Well, she turned me in so we're no longer friends. ; Therapist: No longer friends. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Have you had any other trouble with the law? ; Patient: Well, basically when I was younger, I got, I used to get into a lot of fights. ; Therapist: Mm hmm. ; Therapist: Um, who's they? ; Patient: My family. ; Patient: Um, I used to get into a lot of physical altercations and there was this one time when I beat this girl up and they told me that they had to pull me off of her. ; Patient: So. ; Therapist: You remember doing it? ; Patient: Uh, yeah I remember doing it. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Mm hmm. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: And how old are you when that happened? ; Therapist: Do you remember? ; Patient: I was about 12. ; Therapist: About 12 years old. ; Therapist: Were you ever treated for that? ; Therapist: Like any type of mental health treatment? ; Patient: Uh, well, they put me in some sort of detention center. ; Therapist: Mm hmm. ; Patient: Um, and I guess they gave me some sort of therapy one on one. ; Patient: But nothing any, like nothing serious or like I'm doing now. ; Therapist: Are you aware of any diagnosis that you've been given related to mental health in the past? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So you got into the, sounds like a fairly serious fight when you were 12. ; Patient: Mm hmm. ; Therapist: And you're 25 now. ; Therapist: Can you tell me what's happened in terms of any other problems between 12 and 15? ; Patient: Um, I guess the usual. ; Patient: I mean, I drank and got into some drugs and would use and do stuff like that. ; Patient: So. ; Therapist: Any other thefts or, or assaults or anything? ; Patient: I mean, yeah, I still kept getting into fights and stuff. ; Patient: But, yeah, I think my last real fight was when I was about 20. ; Patient: So, yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Um, and how much danger were the people that you were fighting? ; Patient: Um. ; Therapist: Like, did you seriously hurt them? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: How many times did that happen where you seriously hurt somebody? ; Patient: Probably every fight that I ever gotten into. ; Patient: So, many. ; Patient: Um, I don't have a number. ; Patient: But. ; Therapist: Can you explain what happened? ; Therapist: Like, what caused the fight? ; Patient: So, the one girl, she just, I felt looked at me wrong and I didn't like it. ; Patient: So, I punched her in the mouth. ; Patient: And continued to do so. ; Patient: Until she was on the ground. ; Patient: And then I still continued to do so. ; Therapist: What are your feelings about that? ; Patient: She deserved it. ; Therapist: Because of the way she looked at you? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Do you ever, um, have any feelings of guilt or remorse about it? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Have you ever apologized to any people that were hurt? ; Patient: I've apologized, but just to appease, uh, people so that I didn't get into any more trouble. ; Patient: Also, in some of these situations apologizing was kind of required? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, you apologized to them but you didn't, didn't really mean it? ; Therapist: Or what were you thinking? ; Patient: I didn't mean it. ; Therapist: You didn't mean it? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: It was just to get out of trouble and go on with myself. ; Therapist: Were you successful in getting out of trouble? ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: You say that, um, kind of with a little pride. ; Patient: Something to take pride in? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Therapist: Being able to get out of trouble? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I mean, wouldn't you? ; Therapist: So that's like something you look at as like a skill that you have? ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Have you ever, for like the theft type activities, you ever felt any guilt or remorse there? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's kind of the same thing? ; Patient: Same thing. ; Patient: They, I mean, they had more money than me, so why not? ; Patient: They probably would have done the same thing to me. ; Patient: So, I did it to them before they could do it to me. ; Therapist: Were you ever the victim of a crime? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I'm smarter than most people, so I can probably, I can one-up people. ; Patient: So. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you feel that you're good in working with people, like in terms of social skills? ; Patient: I mean, getting what I want. ; Patient: I can always get what I want. ; Therapist: So you're effective at managing relationships to get what you want? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: How would you describe your mood most of the time? ; Patient: Hmm. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I guess I can get a little irritable. ; Therapist: A little irritable? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: How often does that happen? ; Patient: A few times a week. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Does that irritability ever lead to, or has ever led to some of the aggressiveness? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you're more likely to be aggressive when you've been irritable for a while? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: When was the last time you were involved in a physical fight? ; Patient: So that was around 20. ; Therapist: About five years ago? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What do you think has caused that to stop? ; Patient: Uh, I guess I'm moving on to bigger and better things. ; Therapist: What type of things? ; Patient: Um, stealing. ; Therapist: So the stealing's more gratifying than the fighting? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So irritable, and any other emotions, any other feelings? ; Patient: Uh, I'm not sure. ; Therapist: Not sure? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: You have a job? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Well, I did. ; Therapist: You did? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about your work performance and your experience there? ; Patient: Well, you know, I show up when I need to most of the time, and do what I have to do. ; Therapist: You show up most of the time? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How would your employer describe you as an employee? ; Patient: I mean, I'm pretty good at doing what I do, but I guess my boss would like me to be there more. ; Patient: But when I'm not there, they'll go on without me. ; Patient: So... ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: So in terms of your feelings about missing work, that's not too worrisome for you? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: How many jobs have you had? ; Patient: Probably, like, six. ; Therapist: Six jobs? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: What age did you first start working? ; Patient: Um, 19. ; Therapist: 19 ; Therapist: So six jobs in about six years? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And would you say that your experience with all the employers was the same in terms of how you showed up for work and missing work? ; Therapist: Were any of them different? ; Patient: They wanted me... they tried to get me to conform, I feel. ; Patient: And I'm just not a conformist. ; Therapist: Kind of doing things your own way? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What do you want to gain out of treatment here? ; Patient: I just want to get out of trouble. ; Therapist: You're in trouble now? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And you like to get out of trouble? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Lisa, this has been helpful. ; Therapist: I'm going to get you scheduled for treatment. ; Therapist: And they'll probably get you in about a week. ; Therapist: And we can go from there. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Patient: Thank you.",

; Patient: My thoughts are, like if I'm in the car, I'm going to get hit. ; Patient: If I'm taking a test, it's like, okay I've got to do well on this test. ; Patient: I've got to remember this. ; Patient: There's so much to remember and I just kind of, brain is freezing a little bit and I'm panicking because I can't remember. ; Patient: So I guess I'll allow that. ; Therapist: And so, like with the test, have you found that being a problem as far as not being able to complete the test or not doing well on the test? ; Therapist: Or is it like once you go through it then you're fine? ; Patient: Isn't it like anxiety over when I finish the test? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, after I'm finished. ; Patient: I mean I know I could perform better if I wasn't so anxious. ; Patient: I know it wouldn't take me as long if I wasn't anxious. ; Patient: It seems to, I mean these are like time tests and so when it's over, whether it's an hour or two hours or however long it is, I mean when it's over, you know I'm anxious during it, but when it's over, yeah it kind of subsides. ; Patient: Just like in the car, when I get to the place after I'm off the interstate and stuff, it seems to subside. ; Patient: So when the situation is over, it seems to go down. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you might need to find something that helps you just. ; Patient: Yeah, I want something at the time to help me in the moment because these are things that I mean I can't avoid. ; Patient: I mean even in my job too, I've got to go in my field placement, I've got to do these group settings, you know I've got to do. ; Patient: Some kids are crazy, they're just respectful, it's like okay. ; Patient: I've got to do it though. ; Patient: All these things I have to do, I can't change them in my life right now. ; Patient: So I've got to figure out how to deal with it better. ; Therapist: Okay, well would you like to learn a skill? ; Patient: Yeah, I'm very eager to learn something that can make a difference. ; Therapist: Okay, well there's something called grounding, have you heard that? ; Patient: Grounding, no just electricity, grounding, you know that third plug thing. ; Patient: That's the only grounding I know. ; Patient: Don't be grounded, that sounds good, bring it on. ; Therapist: Being grounded is kind of like working my ego, it's kind of getting to that level place. ; Therapist: So with grounding, a lot of people have a lot of emotions, it's okay to have emotions, but for some people it gets really intense, like you and the inside and it's just a lot. ; Therapist: And so with grounding we're trying to learn ways to bring that down to more of a calm place. ; Therapist: So it doesn't necessarily solve the problem, like there's still traffic, there's still things going on, it just helps you get to a calm place to deal with it. ; Patient: That sounds good. ; Therapist: So I'm going to introduce a grounding technique to you. ; Therapist: It involves some deep breathing, some closing of the eyes, getting to your senses. ; Therapist: So I have a little script to you that I'm going to read to you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we'll go through this and you'll tell me after if you like it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But to begin I just want you to relax and be comfortable and try to get as comfortable as you can. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And now rest your hands on your back, on the side, whatever is more comfortable for you. ; Patient: Okay, that's okay. ; Therapist: I want you to just breathe. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Try to do the deep, the chest rises and breathe in. ; Therapist: Breathe that out. ; Patient: That's good. ; Therapist: So don't worry about doing the breathing light, just whatever is comfortable. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Now we're going to engage in using each of the five senses. ; Therapist: And so for that I want you to close your eyes. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I just want you to listen to my voice and hear my instructions. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So just begin to relax by just noticing all the sounds around you. ; Therapist: And start with hearing. ; Therapist: And whenever you're comfortable you can tell me what you hear. ; Therapist: Any sound. ; Patient: Kind of hear my breath a little bit. ; Patient: I hear the air conditioning going. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Or the heat, whatever that is. ; Patient: The air coming through the mouth. ; Patient: I hear that. ; Therapist: With the constant noise? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: That's kind of all I'm hearing right now. ; Therapist: Do you think you noticed the sound before of the air belt? ; Patient: Mm-mm. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I'm just hearing it now. ; Therapist: Starting to hear more now. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Let's move on to smell. ; Therapist: Do you smell anything in that body? ; Patient: Hmm. ; Patient: I don't think I smell much. ; Patient: Hmm. ; Therapist: It's just totally okay. ; Patient: I don't smell a lot. ; Patient: You know, there's not a lot of scents right now in this room for smelling. ; Patient: There's not a lot of smelling. ; Patient: Foul and bad or good. ; Patient: It's just kind of normal. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: No smells? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: No unusual smells. ; Therapist: No smell of air. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Now I would like for you to open your eyes up. ; Therapist: I'm going to talk about sight. ; Therapist: So just list me some things that you can see in this room right now. ; Patient: I see you. ; Patient: I see that picture right there. ; Patient: I see that sofa right there. ; Patient: And some books and flowers. ; Patient: And I see that deer or whatever it is over there. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's okay. ; Patient: So those are some of the things that I see. ; Therapist: What about the colors of what you see? ; Patient: Um, blue and red and a lot of beige. ; Patient: Orange. ; Patient: Clashing colors. ; Patient: Red and orange. ; Patient: It's one of those go together. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's when you first came here. ; Therapist: Did you notice anything? ; Patient: Well, you know, I thought, I mean I might have noticed some of it. ; Patient: But I'm obviously more aware because I'm really focusing on it right now. ; Patient: So I'm definitely more aware of it right now. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And so next with taste. ; Therapist: Notice I can just tell you if you're in some other situation you can take the time to eat a big snack or something. ; Therapist: Talk about the taste, the textures. ; Therapist: Really slowly eat the food and feel how it is in your mouth and how it tastes and things like that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But you can still do it even without food. ; Therapist: Just simply taste enough saliva in your mouth. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I feel kind of dry at the moment. ; Therapist: A little dry? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Are there any tastes you could think of? ; Therapist: Maybe something you ate this morning? ; Patient: Well, I had a granola bar and a banana earlier. ; Patient: So I've had some tea. ; Patient: The flavor right now in my mouth is probably the tea that I just had most recently. ; Patient: So that's the tea. ; Therapist: So that's your taste? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And then finally the touch. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: The final sense. ; Therapist: So where do your hands are right now? ; Patient: Well, I've had it. ; Patient: This is kind of a habit of mine. ; Patient: So I was feeling my hands. ; Patient: Maybe my hands are supposed to be here. ; Therapist: I just want to put your hands on that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So describe to me how it feels. ; Patient: It feels solid. ; Patient: Feels soft. ; Patient: And it's not rough or wrinkly or anything like that. ; Patient: It feels secure. ; Patient: Like okay, this is going to hold me. ; Patient: It's a good feeling. ; Patient: I'm comfortable. ; Patient: It feels comfortable. ; Therapist: Well, that's something else I know. ; Therapist: Maybe your phone or something. ; Therapist: Describe that to me. ; Patient: This is hard. ; Patient: And I've got this cushy case on it. ; Patient: So it's kind of feeling a little cushy. ; Patient: But it's hard. ; Therapist: What about the paper? ; Therapist: More like this paper? ; Patient: Soaky and smooth and bendable and thin and slick. ; Patient: Just trying to know how that feels. ; Patient: Is that it? ; Patient: Mmhmm. ; Therapist: Just feel like I want you to be comfortable and I want you to take a deep breath three times. ; Therapist: Take your time. ; Therapist: Now, I'd like for us to go with your eyes closed and come up with a statement. ; Therapist: Say to yourself, I'm going to be okay scripture anu words like that. ; Therapist: Do you want to be okay? ; Therapist: Let's see. ; Patient: You do need to encourage yourself. ; Patient: You can do it. ; Therapist: If you feel that it's good, I'll just step aside and be okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Mmhmm. ; Therapist: So I want you to say your statement out loud. ; Therapist: I can do it. ; Patient: I can do it. ; Therapist: Same with confidence. ; Patient: I can do it. ; Therapist: Okay, then you can open your eyes now. ; Therapist: So what we just did, we just went through each of the senses as a way of, a bit of a distraction from what we know. ; Therapist: It's also can be common for you to just focus your mind on things and not go into the details of something else going on. ; Therapist: It's really important that you breathe through it and at the end you can say, I can do it. ; Therapist: So how was that for you? ; Patient: Well, wow. ; Patient: It kind of did calm you down. ; Patient: I was kind of getting anxious telling you what made me anxious and so I was kind of rubbed up and then I kind of forgot about it. ; Patient: Because I was focusing on what I was seeing and what I was feeling and what I was, you know, all my senses. ; Patient: So it was very distracting in a good way. ; Patient: It got my mind off that and kind of got me onto something else. ; Patient: And then, yeah, it really did calm me down. ; Therapist: Was there a certain sense that you liked, that you found the most helpful? ; Patient: Probably right here, since I'm not eating, probably what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing. ; Patient: Those two things seem to be most helpful in this situation. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: That feeling too. ; Therapist: So let's think about how we can use this when you're driving. ; Therapist: Because obviously you can't close your eyes. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: True, true, true, true. ; Therapist: So what can you do while you're driving? ; Therapist: What senses can you use? ; Patient: Seeing, obviously. ; Patient: My eyes better be open, I better be observant about what I'm seeing. ; Patient: Feeling, I've got my hands on the wheel so I'm going to be feeling something. ; Patient: So, and hearing. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what kind of hearing do you have, any kind of peaceful music you can listen to? ; Patient: Well, that's a good idea. ; Patient: A lot of times I'm going to listen to NPR. ; Patient: And sometimes that's good, sometimes that's not good. ; Patient: It doesn't necessarily calm me down. ; Patient: Sometimes I can, yeah, so I can listen to some more soothing music. ; Patient: Something that calms me down more. ; Therapist: Also, not having the music, just the sound of the world. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: The car is going by. ; Patient: Yeah, I think the music might help me more. ; Patient: Because, not that I want to be distracted from the cars, but I think the music might calm me down more than having nothing. ; Patient: You know, like quiet and hearing the cars and the road. ; Patient: I can see that might make me nervous. ; Patient: I need to be aware of them, but I think I want to hear music. ; Patient: So, I'll try that. ; Therapist: And then I'll always be the sight. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Getting the camera too distracted while I drive. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Focusing on the car in front of you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Not necessarily the one behind me that might hit me. ; Patient: Because I can't do anything too much about that. ; Patient: So, okay, okay. ; Therapist: Now let's think about when, I've only taken the test. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, what senses can we tap into there? ; Patient: Well, what I'm looking at definitely I need to focus on. ; Patient: Because I'm reading something of course and I'm feeling my pen. ; Patient: Most of it's on the computer, so I'm feeling the typewriter, typewriter keyboard. ; Patient: So, that's a sense, a touching thing that I've got to focus on and seeing as paying attention to the words on the front of me. ; Therapist: The hearing. ; Patient: The hearing. ; Patient: I like to be kind of quiet. ; Therapist: But just like today, when you can hear the... ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: To try to hear the... ; Patient: That's it to hear. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Because for us to not think too much about the function of things or, you know, like when you're tapping people you don't really have to type a word. ; Therapist: You're just feeling the keyboard. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You know, it's your arms. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Kind of being aware that it is there and this is there. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, the next time when you're feeling that, try to tap into the senses. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: If you want to take just a five minute break and so for each sense, like dedicate one minute to the sense. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Like before I start the test or before I start to drive or something. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Before you start to drive. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Start the test. ; Patient: Kind of do that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And also remember at the end your statement. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Which is... ; Patient: I can do this. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Patient: That's it. ; Patient: Gasto. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I can do this. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, when do you think the next time you could do this? ; Patient: Well, I got to drive home. ; Patient: So, probably today when I drive home I could do that. ; Patient: A test. ; Patient: I don't really have a test until next week but I drive all the time and so every day I could try this. ; Therapist: So, what about before you even leave? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: To drive like when you're sitting. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Get ready in the parking lot. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Take that time to go on yourself. ; Patient: I take a few minutes to go through all the senses. ; Patient: Focus on that. ; Patient: Put some soothing music on. ; Patient: Say, I can do it and then proceed. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: That's my little homework assignment for you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: I'll try that. ; Therapist: You can try that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And see how it goes. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we'll talk about it. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: That's so we can see how it is for you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Cool. ; Patient: Thanks. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Sure. ; Patient: I'll take some practice but. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Because different situations, you might not use all the senses. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Don't try to focus too much on doing it absolutely right. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Just anything that can make you aware of your surroundings. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: And calm you down. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: That's good. ; Therapist: Well, thank you for coming in today. ; Patient: All right. ; Patient: Well, thanks for that. ; Patient: I'll try and get it out. ; Therapist: All right.",

; Patient: I think more just so that, you know, my ideas were just kind of higher than what they could really understand, so maybe learn how to talk to other people so that they can understand me. ; Therapist: Okay, and what do you mean by higher? ; Therapist: Like, your ideas were higher? ; Patient: You know, just a little bit more intelligent. ; Patient: You know, I'm just at a level that other people can't always reach to. ; Patient: You know, just a little bit higher, sometimes a lot higher, but just on this team, they just couldn't understand, you know, my language or what I was saying, and I couldn't see the vision that I had. ; Therapist: Okay, so they were unable to reach your level of expression for this, it was like a project you were working on? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Was it? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And your boss recognized this difference and thought that the counseling may be helpful? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you think, you know, counseling will be helpful? ; Patient: I think it's good, you know, so that my boss is happy that I went, but I think it could also be useful in the sense of, you know, other people are just jealous of me a lot and they just can't really relate to me, so it might be, you know, great to learn how to really, you know, like, kind of understand what they're going through at their level. ; Therapist: Again, you say at their level, so are you meaning, again, that they're kind of below you with your skills and- ; Patient: Yeah, they're just, they haven't accomplished as much, you know, they don't know as many people, ; Patient: they're not hanging out with those prestigious ranks, you know, they haven't been educated to the quality that I have been, so they just, sometimes it's hard for them to understand where I'm coming from or, you know, what I can see happening. ; Therapist: Okay, so counseling can help you bridge that gap? ; Therapist: Okay, so counseling can help you bridge that gap to communicate more effectively? ; Patient: Yeah, so I can, you know, so I can be even better. ; Patient: You know, I'm here, but I want to be like here. ; Therapist: Alright, so when you say you're here at the first level- Not first, but like, still more. ; Patient: Still more. ; Patient: Still more. ; Therapist: So like, where you are, tell me where you are currently in terms of how you perceive yourself, like how you look at yourself. ; Patient: Maybe like a seven, but I want to like blow it out of the park. ; Patient: You know, like if ten is here, I want to be higher than that. ; Therapist: How would you plan on accomplishing that? ; Patient: Well, you know, I'm always getting recruited for these really prestigious classes and to speak places and people are always calling. ; Patient: I have a really large social media presence, so people are constantly asking me for advice, you know, just about everything. ; Patient: Because, you know, I've just accomplished so much that I'm just, I can really help people because I just, you know, I've just been really lucky to just be good at so many things. ; Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like you have a lot of strengths. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: And that maybe from your understanding that people are just getting jealous because you seem to succeed in so many things. ; Patient: Yeah, you know, like sometimes people just, it's hard to admit that you're just not as good, or like you can't do it. ; Patient: Maybe people don't want to admit that and I think I make them uncomfortable because I can. ; Therapist: So counseling will help you to relate to them in a way that, so how would they, in a more productive way, how would they describe you, you know, given this level of difference that you're talking about, how would they describe you if I were to ask them, if I could ask them, could you describe Sam what they say? ; Patient: I think they would say that I have a lot of people that look up to me, that I'm excellent at my job, that, you know, like I should really be vice president, if not president, but I mean I don't own the company, but I should really have a more significant position. ; Patient: That a lot of the presentations that are happening that I could probably do, but they don't want to, you know, other people need opportunities, but it would be clear for everyone if I just did them. ; Therapist: It would be easier? ; Patient: Yeah, you know, easier, better, more people, it would just be, it would be a great presentation if I did it, so it would just cut away all the other stuff. ; Therapist: All the other stuff, that's what your co-workers would include? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Things that maybe detract from the... ; Patient: Right, like if, you know, if I was doing the sales pitches, we would blow it out of the park. ; Patient: I mean, we'd be multi-millionaires by now. ; Patient: So, you know, it would get rid of all that, you know, the grunt work type of stuff if I just did it myself. ; Therapist: Does it frustrate you that you're not called on for every task? ; Therapist: Are you not recognized? ; Patient: Sometimes, but I've gotten really good at reminding people that they should be calling on me for every task, because, you know, sometimes you just have to show them, you know, I'm better than that person or I could do it better, and I'm really good at that type of communication, so I've been able to secure a lot of positions that weren't given to me at first because they realize, like, oh, she's better at it. ; Therapist: So they can see your talent. ; Therapist: So they recognize you much of the time? ; Patient: I mean, most of the time. ; Patient: Most of the time. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Therapist: How long have you been with this particular employer? ; Patient: Maybe like six months. ; Patient: Six months. ; Patient: Maybe eight. ; Therapist: Eight months, okay. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about the job you had prior, like what happened there? ; Patient: I outgrew them. ; Patient: So I got it to a really, you know, large leadership position, and then, you know, the other VP couldn't really see what I was going for. ; Patient: She couldn't relate to me, and she, you know, she wasn't from the same type of like collegiate background, so that was kind of an issue. ; Patient: So I just outgrew what they had to offer, and then this company came in and made this tremendous offer with, you know, it was just fantastic. ; Patient: So I just had to make a move that was more strategic for me, and, you know, that I could even reach more. ; Patient: You know, I didn't want to be satisfied there. ; Therapist: You wanted to shoot higher. ; Therapist: You wanted to accomplish something greater. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you still wanted to. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I want to be remembered, legendary, you know. ; Patient: I want my name to be out there. ; Patient: It's already out there, but more so. ; Patient: But more so. ; Therapist: More so. ; Therapist: You've already achieved some level of popularity. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: More than most people my age. ; Therapist: More than most people your age, and you really want to take it further. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: You know, like even with like my social media platforms or whatever, people really rely on what I have to say, you know. ; Patient: So the more people that are following me, the more people that are with me, you know, that's what I need. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So your last employer, the one before the place you work now, you just outgrew that. ; Therapist: Can you tell me how that interaction went? ; Patient: Like did you quit or did they kind of encourage you to leave? ; Therapist: Like what happened kind of at the last moments of that job? ; Patient: Well, I mean, I mean I quit. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I mean like, yeah, I quit. ; Patient: I was the one that initiated that. ; Patient: I mean they had some issues, but I was the one that initiated it because I needed to go elsewhere. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you initiated it and you quit. ; Patient: At the same time, they had a few issues. ; Therapist: What type of issues did they have? ; Patient: They just said I talked too much or something like that or I think there was an issue with somebody I was working with or something. ; Patient: But it was really, it was another situation that just didn't, we just weren't communicating well. ; Patient: But in the end, I had to do what was best for me. ; Patient: So, because afterwards they were calling me and trying to get me back, but I was already here, so I wasn't going to go back there. ; Therapist: So after you quit, they pursued you to come work for them again? ; Patient: Yeah, which I told them was going to happen. ; Therapist: You had predicted that when you left? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: I was like, you're going to miss me because I'm the reason this company is flourishing. ; Therapist: So what did you tell them when they offered you the job back? ; Patient: That I was, had gotten a phenomenal job and it was way better and that they lost it and they could just deal with it. ; Therapist: So you rejected them at that point? ; Patient: Oh yeah. ; Therapist: So, you feel as though you could benefit from the counseling here to better relate to people who are different levels, different ability levels? ; Patient: Yeah, and I, you know, I want to make my boss happy, but I feel like it would be good, you know, I don't want to make people feel bad because they're inferior to me and because they're not as successful, so if I could learn how to, you know, talk with them so that I'm not, you know, so they don't feel bad about themselves. ; Therapist: Is your boss putting, I mean, she encouraged you to come here today. ; Therapist: Is she putting any pressure on you? ; Therapist: Like, is this something that's strongly encouraged, mandatory? ; Patient: I think it's, I think it's strongly encouraged, but I think she has a promotion for me in mind, so it's probably just to set me up for that. ; Patient: So she's trying to help you for the future for another advancement. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So Sam, I'm going to get you on the calendar as to see a counselor. ; Therapist: I'm hoping later this week. ; Therapist: Does that work for you? ; Patient: Yeah, okay. ; Therapist: That does? ; Therapist: Are you sure? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So I'll get you set up for that. ; Therapist: I really appreciate you taking the time with me. ; Therapist: It was helpful. ; Therapist: We'll get you into see a counselor and we'll go from there. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Thanks. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Andy, do you want to come on in and have a seat? ; Therapist: I'm Dr Taylor, I'm the on-call psychiatrist for this afternoon. ; Therapist: I got a call this morning from your family doctor, because I think you went to see him this morning along with your mum, and I gather that things have been a little bit difficult for you, you've had some other distressing experiences, so I think your doctor thought it might be helpful for us to have a bit of a discussion about that, to see if I could help. ; Therapist: Would that be alright with you? ; Patient: No, it's fine. ; Therapist: Would it be alright Andy for you to tell me a little bit about what's been going on? ; Patient: Well, you're going to think it sounds stupid, but my housemates are working for MI5, and they're doing stuff to my brain, and they're out to get me. ; Therapist: OK, that must be very difficult for you. ; Therapist: How long has this been going on for Andy? ; Patient: About two months. ; Therapist: And how did you first work out that this was happening? ; Patient: I came home one time and moved the TV to the other side of the room, and I knew then. ; Therapist: What was it that you knew at that moment? ; Patient: That they were for MI5. ; Therapist: Right, OK. ; Therapist: So it's been going on a couple of months? ; Patient: Yeah, this new lecturer started at uni, and he worked for MI5, and he basically drafted me housemates in, turned them against me. ; Therapist: OK, OK. ; Therapist: Now I've noticed a couple of times while we've been talking that you've sort of looked round you into the room as if you're checking for something. ; Therapist: Could I ask you what's happening at those times? ; Patient: Well, I can hear them talking about me. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Who is it you can hear? ; Patient: My housemates. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So that you recognise it as their voices? ; Patient: Yeah, I can hear them all the time. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: How many voices can you hear, Andy? ; Patient: Three, there's three of them. ; Therapist: OK, and do they sound real, like my voice sounds, talking to you now? ; Patient: Yeah, it's odd. ; Patient: It's like I can hear them when they're not here. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So when they're not in the house with you? ; Patient: Yeah, it's like they're in the other room or something. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And can you hear what they're actually saying? ; Patient: Yeah, they're talking about me. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: They're always talking about me. ; Patient: They're always commenting on everything that I'm doing. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Can you give me an example of what they would say? ; Patient: Well, like if I'm packing me back to go to uni or something, they'll comment on that, like you've left the house now. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: Anything else? ; Therapist: Do they ever talk to each other, perhaps, about you? ; Patient: Yeah, that's what they do. ; Patient: I mean, and now they know the sort of twig that I know about them now. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: They're saying like I'm making trouble. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: And that they're going to sort me out. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: What about actually talking directly to you in the way that I'm talking to you now? ; Therapist: Does that ever happen, Andy? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So you've been hearing the voices of your housemates. ; Therapist: Have there been any other changes? ; Therapist: Have there been any changes, perhaps, to the way you're thinking? ; Therapist: Sometimes people tell us that they're thinking changes in some way. ; Therapist: So, for example, they might feel that they're getting thoughts put into their head that aren't their own. ; Therapist: Have you had any experiences like that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I do think things that aren't me. ; Patient: OK. ; Patient: Like they're putting stuff in my brain. ; Patient: It's not me. ; Patient: I'm not thinking. ; Patient: So different thoughts in your brain. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: It's stupid stuff as well. ; Patient: It's like the other day I suddenly just started thinking about some woman in Carnation Street. ; Patient: I don't watch any of that crap. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: It's not your kind of thing normally. ; Patient: They're not my thoughts. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And do you have any idea how that's happening? ; Therapist: Or who's responsible? ; Patient: It's MI5. ; Patient: It's this chip they're putting in my head. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: And I can feel it all the time. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So you're getting thoughts put into your brain that aren't your own. ; Therapist: What about a different sort of experience? ; Therapist: What about the experience that somehow other people are able to know what you're thinking even though you haven't actually told them? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Nothing like that? ; Patient: They're just putting stuff in my head. ; Therapist: Just putting stuff. ; Therapist: And can I just check Andy as well that you're not getting the experience when your thoughts just stop altogether like you have no thoughts left? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: If anything, there's too much in there. ; Patient: I wish I could unplug it. ; Patient: OK. ; Patient: OK. ; Patient: Just get this thing out of my head. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And you mentioned this chip or this device in your brain. ; Therapist: Do you want to tell me a bit more about that? ; Patient: Well, it's a tracking device so they know where I am at all times and I can feel it moving around, like rotating around. ; Therapist: So you can feel the physical sensation in your brain? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: That must be very difficult for you. ; Patient: I don't know why they're doing this to me. ; Patient: I've done nothing wrong. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: Can I just check? ; Therapist: Are there any problems, Andy, with the rest of your body? ; Therapist: Any changes in sensation or any bits that feel different in any way? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I feel fine. ; Patient: I'm not ill or anything. ; Patient: I just want this thing out of my head. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: It sounds like a very difficult time for you. ; Therapist: Can I ask you, Andy, how are you coping with all this? ; Therapist: How is it affecting you? ; Patient: Well, I know we're leaving my room much and I sort of have to wait until they go out to go down and get some food. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: But they've been doing stuff to my food now. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: What do you think is happening to your food? ; Patient: The poison in it. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Are you actually eating much at the moment? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Now, with all this happening, and this sounds like you don't feel very safe, have I got that right? ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Have you felt the need, I don't know, to take steps to protect yourself in any way? ; Patient: Well, I've got a knife. ; Patient: OK. ; Patient: And I've got like a baseball bat. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: It's just in case they get in my room. ; Patient: I just don't want to hurt anyone. ; Patient: I just feel like I've got to protect myself. ; Patient: It's like cornering me to do this. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Have you felt the need to use either the knife or the baseball bat so far? ; Therapist: I'll take it out with you for protection. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No, I don't want to get caught. ; Patient: OK. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: It's just in my room. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Has it ever got so bad, Andy, that you've felt the need to hurt yourself or even kill yourself as the only way out, the only way of coping with this? ; Patient: Well, I thought about getting some pills, but I couldn't leave the house, so I didn't get anything. ; Therapist: And when you say getting some pills, would that be to take an overdose of tablets? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But you've not actually done anything about that so far. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: In the past, have you ever had any problems either with your temper or getting into fights, being aggressive, either with your housemates or anybody else? ; Patient: No, I'm not that kind of person. ; Patient: I don't want to hurt anybody. ; Patient: They're just driving me to this. ; Therapist: And can I just check again? ; Therapist: You've not been in trouble with the police or anything like that? ; Therapist: No, never. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: With all this that's going on, is there anywhere at the moment, Andy, that you feel safe? ; Patient: My parents' house. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And have you seen much of your parents recently? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I thought about going back there, but I don't want to drag them into this. ; Patient: I don't want them or if I've known about them. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And throughout this last couple of months, when you've had all these worries, have you ever worried that your parents might in some way be involved in this? ; Therapist: I thought about it, but no. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Can I just check out a couple of background things with you, Andy? ; Therapist: You're general health. ; Therapist: Is that OK? ; Therapist: You generally fit and well? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: I'm not ill. ; Patient: There's nothing wrong with me. ; Patient: It's just this thing in my head. ; Therapist: And you're not on any regular medication from your own doctor at this stage? ; Patient: No, I don't take any pills. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: What about other drugs? ; Therapist: And by that I'm meaning alcohol, cannabis, pills, anything else? ; Patient: I don't drink much alcohol. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And what about drugs like cannabis? ; Patient: Is my mum going to know about this? ; Therapist: No, I think it's something that's important that I hear about, but this wouldn't be something we'd be discussing with your mum. ; Patient: I smoke a bit of weed. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Would that be regularly for most days? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how much would you be spending on weed? ; Patient: I get like a ten bag, it lasts me a day or so. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So you have a ten bag lasting you a day of weed. ; Therapist: Any other drugs? ; Therapist: I'm thinking in particular things like speed or pills. ; Patient: I've done a bit of speed. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Is that on a regular basis, Andy? ; Patient: I was grabbing my mates for the weekend, we'd do a bit, but... ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: When was the last time, Andy, that you would have had any speed? ; Patient: About a week or so ago. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Any other drugs at all? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: But I know what you're getting at, though. ; Patient: It's not the drugs. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: This is... It doesn't matter how out my face I get, this is constantly there, it's always there. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: I guess the reason I was checking, I think is what you've picked up on, is that sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are, they find if they take certain drugs it can make things feel a lot worse. ; Therapist: I just wanted to check if that hadn't been your experience. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: I appreciate from what you're saying that you're really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that that's the cause of the difficulties that you're having at the moment. ; Therapist: I just wanted to check with you. ; Therapist: Do you think it could be due to anything else? ; Therapist: I mean, I've obviously met other people who've had similar experiences and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be actually mentally unwell. ; Therapist: And just whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment? ; Patient: No, because I'm not ill. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: It's them and I've read books on this as well. ; Patient: I don't... The government know about them. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: They know that they do this to loads of people. ; Patient: I don't know how they can get away with it. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I've done nothing wrong. ; Patient: I don't know why they're doing this to me. ; Patient: OK. ; Therapist: I just want it... I just want it to stop. ; Patient: OK. ; Patient: Sure. ; Patient: And I think I can appreciate that. ; Therapist: I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor that sometimes meeting with someone like I've met with someone who's been in the hospital for a long time, I think, is a really important thing. ; Therapist: Meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful. ; Therapist: Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, I'm only here really because of my mum. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: I tried to... I don't want to worry her. ; Patient: I've tried to talk to her about it and she doesn't understand. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: She doesn't really believe me. ; Patient: I mean... ; Patient: Do you believe me? ; Therapist: Well, I certainly believe that you're having a really difficult time at the moment. ; Therapist: I guess what I'm not as sure about is what's causing this and I'm less sure this is due to MI5. ; Therapist: I guess what I'm wondering is that perhaps you're not as well as you might be at the moment. ; Therapist: I mean, we've been through a lot of questions and what I'm thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this. ; Therapist: So I'm wondering, because I know your mum is... I think she's waiting in the waiting room. ; Therapist: It might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some proper support. ; Therapist: Would that be alright if I got your mum in? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If you want to sit there then, Andy, I'll just get your mum. ; Therapist: Okay.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Daisy, how you're doing today? ; Patient: Not well. ; Therapist: Not well? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: What's going on? ; Patient: Well, remember I had told you that they were downsizing at my job. ; Therapist: I remember that. ; Patient: So I've been there 20 years at my job. ; Therapist: A long time. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And they're downsizing lately and they let me go. ; Therapist: Well, that's terrible. ; Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. ; Patient: Thanks. ; Therapist: Do you have any type of severance or anything like that? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: So yeah, it's just, you know, they let me go. ; Patient: I have really nothing to go on. ; Patient: I don't know what to do. ; Patient: I've been at that job so long. ; Patient: I really don't know how to do anything else. ; Therapist: You used to talk about that job. ; Therapist: You were happy there. ; Patient: Yeah, I was. ; Patient: I thought, you know, I envisioned doing that job forever, for a long time. ; Patient: So, you know. ; Therapist: And that's not going to happen now? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: How does this affect your financial outlook, like your bills and such? ; Patient: Oh, it's awful. ; Patient: I mean, we definitely, my husband and I, it's really spiraled out of control. ; Patient: My husband and I have kind of like joined. ; Patient: We pay the bills together and so this was half of our income and that's gone. ; Patient: And because it was kind of more sudden, we didn't really have time to do anything else. ; Patient: You know, time to prepare. ; Therapist: So it definitely caught you off guard. ; Therapist: Do you have enough income with your husband's job to cover your basic bills? ; Patient: We're a little bit behind. ; Therapist: A little bit behind? ; Patient: Yeah, so far. ; Patient: But if I don't find a job soon, then I don't know what's going to happen. ; Patient: I don't know how bad it's going to get. ; Therapist: Do you know about how long you have before you fail to meet any financial commitments? ; Patient: My husband usually deals with the bills, so I'm not quite sure. ; Patient: But probably in another month or so, it's going to get really bad. ; Therapist: About a month? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What thoughts have you been having? ; Patient: All sorts. ; Patient: I mean, I worry that, you know, like my husband and I are arguing because we're under all this stress. ; Patient: I worry we're going to lose our house. ; Patient: You know, I'm worried about going to be homeless. ; Patient: You know, it's embarrassing. ; Patient: I don't have a job now. ; Patient: What if I don't find another job? ; Patient: You know, what are my kids going to do? ; Patient: My kids are, you know, relying on us to meet their needs. ; Therapist: They depend on you. ; Patient: Yeah, so I mean, we could be homeless. ; Patient: I might not ever get a job again. ; Patient: You know, I'm not getting any younger. ; Patient: So I just, I'm afraid that I won't get another job. ; Therapist: Now you said you were laid off, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: From the position. ; Therapist: Are you eligible for an unemployment? ; Patient: I'm not sure. ; Patient: I'm still looking into that. ; Therapist: Because if you were, I mean, I'm not a labor law expert. ; Therapist: I think if you're laid off, there's probably a decent probability you could get unemployment. ; Therapist: How much of your education are you? ; Patient: I just have my bachelor's. ; Therapist: Well, that's more than most, right? ; Therapist: Your bachelor's degree. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You just haven't had to look for a job in a long time. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: 20 years, right? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Because I'm guessing you thought you were going to retire. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: There, right. ; Therapist: So this is upsetting for a lot of reasons. ; Therapist: So you have the financial stressors, right? ; Therapist: That can't be minimized. ; Therapist: The relational stressors. ; Therapist: You mentioned it's kind of embarrassing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So it's more like an identity thing, right? ; Therapist: So you identify with what you did. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And now you don't as much because you're not actively working on it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Did you ever have any coworkers who voluntarily left for other jobs? ; Patient: Not that I know of. ; Therapist: Not the time you worked there? ; Patient: Not that I was aware of. ; Patient: I don't think. ; Patient: Maybe like one a while ago, but it was a pretty good job, so. ; Therapist: So a lot of people stayed. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you ever known anybody who worked for a similar company or in the same field who changed jobs? ; Patient: Yeah, one of my friends was in a similar field and left the job and eventually found another job. ; Therapist: Yeah, how long it took them? ; Patient: It took a while. ; Patient: It took a while. ; Patient: Like maybe like two years or so at least. ; Therapist: A long while. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It was a struggle for their family, so I think about that. ; Therapist: Would you need to replace that full income to pay your bills or part of that income? ; Patient: I mean, probably part of it. ; Patient: Maybe full would be ideal because, you know, we were comfortable the way we were living. ; Patient: So full would be ideal, but, you know, we could probably survive on part of it. ; Patient: It's just not as well as we were living. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So we've talked about problem solving skills before in earlier sessions, right? ; Therapist: So have you applied any of those concepts to what's going on now? ; Patient: I mean, I've been trying to think of, you know, different opportunities that might be open to me now and, you know, being able to spend more time with my kids and things like that. ; Patient: I've been trying to think of it other ways, my situation. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So there's an upside in that sense, the time part. ; Therapist: At some point you need to replace the income. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's very pragmatic. ; Therapist: You need the money. ; Therapist: Have you considered that if you attempted to seek a full time job, didn't work out, you could look at part time jobs? ; Patient: I've thought about it, but I'm really having a hard time with it. ; Therapist: What would it mean about you, what would it say about you if you had to take a part time job instead of finding another full time job that's so much of the one you lost? ; Patient: What would it mean about me? ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: That I think if I only had a part time job that I wasn't qualified, that I wasn't good enough for a full time job. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you would internalize that and the meaning would be that you're not as valuable? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So it speaks to self worth. ; Therapist: That kind of thinking we've talked about before, right, in other situations can impede you trying to meet your goal. ; Therapist: So what do you do when you're feeling not worthy, when you're feeling worthless? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What do you do? ; Patient: Well, right now it's not going well. ; Patient: I mean, I've been arguing with my husband. ; Patient: I've been drinking a lot more. ; Patient: You know, the depression has come back a lot worse. ; Patient: So it's just starting to become this cycle where I'm drinking and getting into arguments and situations are not getting better and it just keeps snowballing. ; Therapist: Keeps snowballing. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And these behaviors are all things that potentially could impede your goal. ; Therapist: So in a way, there's kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy element to this. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You agonize, you worry, invest in these thoughts. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And then to temporarily take away the pain you drink that ends up in more dysfunction, right, with the relationship with your husband. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: I imagine if you're intoxicated, you're not looking for new work. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: That wouldn't be ideal timing. ; Therapist: So in a sense, you're not helping things to improve and it all kind of starts with that thinking. ; Patient: But it's hard when I'm really depressed and the situation's not getting better and I'm just home sitting about drinking while everyone else is carrying on with their life and I'm stuck here. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And that ties into that kind of worthless type thought, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you're fulfilling that role of being worthless. ; Therapist: That's how it's manifesting for you. ; Therapist: And that's one thing you can do. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: That's an option. ; Therapist: You can drink and you can have relational struggles. ; Therapist: But is that really what you want out of all this? ; Therapist: Is that the most useful? ; Patient: No, I know it's not helping. ; Therapist: How do you think you could break that cycle? ; Patient: I've been thinking about trying to get more organized, like we talked about before with the finances, and trying to figure out exactly how much income we need to be where we want, but to do it maybe by baby steps. ; Patient: So it's not so overwhelming for me, this thought of getting a new job and making enough money and providing for my family. ; Patient: It's kind of like breaking it down. ; Therapist: Well, that makes sense. ; Therapist: So your first step would be figuring out what's the minimum amount you really need. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So you'll shoot for hire, you'll go for it full time, but you realize that you kind of need to know what the minimum is because you know what job offer you could accept and what job offer you'd have to decline. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So that makes sense. ; Therapist: So armed with that information, then you could go out to the workplace. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And maybe with a little less anxiety, kind of just know, well, this job's going to, if I get it, that's good. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Or I might as well not apply to this one because it's not going to work. ; Therapist: So it's efficient, it's time-saving. ; Therapist: It's good. ; Therapist: That sounds logical. ; Therapist: What do you think could get in the way of those steps? ; Therapist: What obstacles are you seeing? ; Patient: I think just sometimes like the fear of the unknown, like worry about what if this never happens for me? ; Patient: You know, what if I don't get a job? ; Patient: You know, what if we lose our house? ; Patient: What if? ; Therapist: That worry's nagging. ; Patient: What if? ; Therapist: Yeah, that worry's nagging. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So I think it's pretty likely that with a bachelor's degree, in the background we've talked about other sessions, that you'll get a job. ; Therapist: Let's go with the scenario that you don't. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And with the understanding that's a pretty low probability event. ; Therapist: Let's just say, okay, what happens then? ; Therapist: Say you never find another job. ; Therapist: That's the worst case. ; Therapist: Like we would agree that's the worst case. ; Patient: Yeah, it's pretty awful. ; Therapist: That's pretty awful. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: That's the worst case scenario. ; Therapist: Can't get any worse than that. ; Therapist: What would happen? ; Patient: I mean, worst case, if we don't get a job, I mean, we would probably, I don't know, like get a smaller house or find a way around it. ; Patient: I mean, we've been through some tough times. ; Therapist: It would be difficult, right? ; Therapist: To be fair, right? ; Therapist: It would be difficult, but you would adapt. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: So, like, it would be difficult, but I think if I really thought about it, you know, we would probably get through it. ; Therapist: So, if we pick up with that, if we say that's really an adaptive response. ; Therapist: Remember we talked about adaptive responses. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: To automatic thoughts, right? ; Therapist: So, if you're telling yourself that you have the depression and certain anxiety, the craving to drink, you tell yourself, well, the worst that could happen is I don't work for the rest of my life. ; Therapist: Again, acknowledging that's pretty unlikely, right? ; Therapist: But the worst that could happen is I won't work again, and I might have to adapt. ; Therapist: I might have to have a simpler life in terms of material goods and a smaller house, but I would survive. ; Therapist: What effect might that have on your mood or your thoughts? ; Patient: I mean, I think when I really think about it, you know, like you said, I think I'm less depressed or think that I'm more able to cope with it, you know, knowing, okay, well, this is the worst that could happen, but maybe it's not as bad as I thought it would be in my head. ; Therapist: So, there's a piece that comes with clarity that comes with accepting what the worst case scenario could be. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And probably another part of the adaptive response could be, you know, I could live through the worst case scenario, but I think it's important though to acknowledge that it's unlikely. ; Therapist: That's still unlikely. ; Therapist: So, statistics, probability is on your side here. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So, as you go out into the workplace, the workforce and seek employment, you'll probably have some interviews where you don't get job offers, right? ; Therapist: But eventually, you'll find out when you do. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: It's just math. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: If you can accept the worst case, then maybe reduce or eliminate that alcohol consumption, maybe reduce that depression, reduce that anxiety. ; Therapist: Does that make sense? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It makes a lot of sense. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, let's end there for today, but I want you to try for the next week, I want you to try applying that adaptive response. ; Therapist: Actually, there's two we talked about, right? ; Therapist: One is you could survive the worst case scenario. ; Therapist: Another one is that probabilistically, it won't happen. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So, you have kind of two, well, you do have two adaptive responses I want you to apply. ; Therapist: When those automatic thoughts come up, like, I'm never going to work again. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: This is a catastrophe. ; Patient: So, like that self-talk. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Apply that self-talk. ; Therapist: So, identify that automatic thought, because we talked about that skill, right? ; Therapist: And then apply that self-talk right away. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: And let's see, you have the thought record? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, when that, you know, when you can, fill one of those out, okay, when that happens. ; Therapist: When you have the automatic thought, then you apply the adaptive response. ; Therapist: Even if you can't get it completely filled out, I understand that. ; Therapist: I know there's a lot on there. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Just what you can get done on that. ; Therapist: Anything you can do on that would be helpful. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Does that sound good? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, I'll schedule you for one week, okay? ; Therapist: So, I'll see you then. ; Therapist: We'll see how this goes. ; Therapist: See what progress we can make on this, on the alcohol, on the depression and anxiety. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Thanks.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: you worry a lot about how you come across in social situations. ; Patient: Yeah, it really makes me feel really anxious, like what I look like and what people are thinking. ; Therapist: Yeah, you said that you worry that you visibly shake. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Are there any other things that you worry that people will notice? ; Patient: I think obviously the shaking, I think my hands and legs shaking and kind of going really red and sweating and just looking really weird. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you have quite a strong mental image of how you see yourself when you're in these social situations. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Therapist: So you go red, you shake. ; Therapist: Is there anything else that you think that you do? ; Therapist: I mean, describe yourself. ; Therapist: How do you think you look when you're in these situations? ; Patient: Just like, I think I just look really obviously weird and out of place and like really red and just visibly shaking and sweating and kind of not being able to communicate properly with people. ; Therapist: Is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things to manage these problems? ; Patient: I guess like when I'm holding the camera, I just grip onto it really, really tight or I kind of clench on my muscles and just find something that I can focus on and to kind of try and make myself shake less and not go as red and stuff. ; Therapist: So you focus on something, you grip onto the camera. ; Therapist: Do you make eye contact with people? ; Patient: No, I just tend to just look down. ; Therapist: Okay, so you also avoid eye contact. ; Therapist: Is there anything else that you do to manage the sweating, for example? ; Patient: Just kind of looking down and wearing all black so it's less obvious or kind of wearing just more layers and all black so you just can't tell. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things, if you stopped gripping onto the camera or you start to make eye contact and not looking down? ; Therapist: What do you think would happen? ; Patient: I think it would be so much worse. ; Patient: I think I would just shake even more and be more anxious and look more obviously kind of weird and out of place. ; Therapist: What I'm thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things? ; Therapist: If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: If we did this maybe twice in the first time, you do all the things that you normally do. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You grip onto something, look down. ; Therapist: Is there anything else that you do when you're in these situations, these work conversations to try and cope? ; Patient: I just kind of fumble and kind of just clench whatever it is I'm holding just really tight and just make sure I don't make any eye contact. ; Patient: I'll just kind of get through it. ; Therapist: Okay, so in the first time I want you to do those things as much as you normally would. ; Therapist: In fact, maybe even slightly more than you normally would. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then the second time I want you to drop doing those things altogether. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: How does that sound? ; Patient: I'll try my best. ; Therapist: How would you feel about if we filmed this so you could actually see what you looked like? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you have a camera with you that we could video on? ; Patient: Yeah, is my phone okay? ; Therapist: Yeah, we'll use that in just a sec. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Before we do this then, we're just going to fill out this form. ; Therapist: What we're doing now is an experiment. ; Therapist: We call it a behavioural experiment to see what happens when you change the way that you're behaving. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Okay, so the first column says I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have. ; Therapist: So our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work. ; Therapist: Who should I play? ; Therapist: If you're playing yourself in this role play, who should I be? ; Patient: Maybe like a client at work. ; Patient: At work I always have to sit down with clients before we do the shoot and get to know a little bit more about what they want. ; Therapist: Okay, so would it work if I was maybe having a wedding and I was hiring you to be a wedding photographer? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What kind of problems do you see coming up in this conversation that we have? ; Therapist: Like what will you see yourself doing on camera? ; Patient: Shaking, like being really obviously shaking and bright red. ; Therapist: Okay, so visibly shaking. ; Therapist: So how much will you be shaking? ; Therapist: If 100 is like shaking uncontrollably and zero is not shaking at all, how visibly shaking will you be? ; Patient: 90 ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Sorry, what was the other thing that you just said? ; Patient: Like I go really red. ; Therapist: Okay, so you're going to go red? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How red will you go? ; Therapist: I mean if we look around this room. ; Patient: Probably like the chairs. ; Therapist: Okay, so you're going to be as kind of brightly pink as these chairs are? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, so out of 100 then how pink would you say these chairs are? ; Patient: 90 out of 100. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What else are you worried is going to happen when we have these conversations? ; Patient: Just worried I'll say something stupid and not be able to kind of get what I'm trying to say across properly. ; Therapist: Okay, and how stupid out of 100 if 100 is ridiculously stupid? ; Patient: Probably like similar 90 I'd say. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: What else are you worried will happen when we have this conversation? ; Therapist: What else might you see on the camera? ; Patient: I think you'll probably be able to see that I'm a bit sweating and... ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And how much will you be sweating? ; Patient: Again, 90 I think. ; Therapist: Like visibly sweating down the face? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And what do you think will happen the second time around when you stop kind of doing the things you normally do to cope when you maybe start to make eye contact and you're not gripping onto something? ; Patient: I think it'll be even worse. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How much worse? ; Therapist: Slightly worse. ; Therapist: Like twice as bad. ; Patient: Twice as bad. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Right, can you give me your phone and we'll... ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Should I just use this? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: It's probably best. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Hi. ; Therapist: So I was just wondering if I could talk to you about maybe doing my wedding photography. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: What kind of, kind of, what kind of things do you see? ; Patient: How do you want it to be like? ; Therapist: I suppose I'd like lots of shots of our family and our friends. ; Therapist: Quite a lot of natural shots. ; Therapist: You know, people talking when they're having drinks. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Do you want it, like, do you kind of see it being outside? ; Patient: Is that something that you're interested in? ; Patient: Outside shots? ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's going to be a summer wedding. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So we'd quite like a lot of outdoors shots. ; Therapist: If possible, you know, if it's not raining, that would be quite nice. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Quite some arty ones if that's possible. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, that would be, I've done quite a few things like that before. ; Therapist: Have you got anything that you could show me about your past work? ; Patient: Yeah, I recently did some shoots outside, kind of in like a wood environment, so that I could show you that maybe it would kind of help with some ideas. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Great. ; Therapist: Right, let's do the second one now. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay, you ready to put down the bottle and just to make eye contact? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Hi, so I was just wondering if I could speak to you about doing my wedding photography? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: What kind of thing are you looking at? ; Patient: How do you want it to be like? ; Therapist: I'd like kind of lots of shots of family and friends and quite a lot of natural shots, you know. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: Are you interested in having things outside maybe? ; Patient: I know you said you wanted it to be natural. ; Therapist: Yeah, because it's going to be a summer wedding and, you know, weather dependent, of course. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It would be really great if we could kind of get lots of shots, you know, outdoors. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah, people chatting and maybe some quite arty ones as well. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you got anything that you could show me about your past work? ; Patient: Yeah, actually it's kind of a lot of the things I do are outside and I'm really interested in getting natural shots. ; Patient: So I could show you some of my work and we could kind of see if we could kind of develop something from that. ; Patient: Could be quite good. ; Therapist: Okay, let's pause it there. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right, I'm just going to give you this back now to look at. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And I just want you to watch that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then we'll chat about it in a moment. ; Patient: Okay. ; Patient: It's weird seeing it. ; Therapist: So if we just go back to the things that you predicted then. ; Therapist: You said that you thought you were going to shake, visibly shake. ; Therapist: Could you see yourself shaking on the video? ; Patient: Definitely not as much as I thought. ; Patient: I think it's obvious that I'm obviously quite anxious but I don't think you can tell I'm shaking that much. ; Therapist: So you said that you were going to shake 90 out of 100. ; Therapist: How much shaking would you say that you saw there in the end? ; Patient: Maybe like less than 30. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You said that you were going to go red or pink, as pink as these chairs, 90 out of 100. ; Therapist: Did you notice yourself going pink? ; Patient: Not really. ; Therapist: Actually definitely less than I thought. ; Therapist: Yeah, not as much. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: You said that you were worried that you were going to say something stupid. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: 90 out of 100. ; Therapist: Did you notice yourself say anything stupid? ; Patient: Not really. ; Patient: Yeah, I thought it was going to be a lot worse than actually it was. ; Therapist: So you thought you were going to say something that was 90% stupid. ; Therapist: That's really quite strong. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: In the end, did you pick up anything that, so could we maybe put that as a zero? ; Patient: Maybe like less than 10 maybe. ; Therapist: You said that you thought you were going to be sweating. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that you were going to be visibly sweating. ; Therapist: Did you notice yourself sweating in the end? ; Patient: Not really. ; Patient: Definitely not as bad as I thought. ; Therapist: Again, you thought you were going to be like 90 out of 100, like seriously visibly sweating. ; Therapist: So what score would you actually give it in the end? ; Patient: Maybe again, less than 10. ; Patient: I don't think you could tell at all. ; Therapist: You also said that you thought it was going to be twice as bad when you stopped using your normal strategies. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What did you notice watching that video? ; Patient: It was actually probably better when I wasn't doing any of those things. ; Patient: I think I looked a lot more natural and I was able to say what I was trying to say. ; Patient: I think I'd just come across more personable when I'm not kind of looking down and stuff.",
    "summary": "Patient Particulars : Nil ; Clinical Identifiers: Nil ; Referral Information : Nil ; Therapist Information : Nil ; Past Session Information: This session seems like a follow-up session as there is no details of initial introductory conversation between both the parties. Also, there is no information regarding the last session as well. ; Presenting Complaints (Symptoms): Presenting symptom anxiety majorly in social situations. Chief complaints 1. Sweating, 2. Body shaking 3. Heat in body which makes him visibly red, 4. Body stiffness clench. ; History: Nil ; Crisis Markers: Nil ; Current Mental Status Examination: General appearance and behaviour there is no description of patients appearance in this session. He seemed cooperative and attentive. Its difficult to say through only transcripts as the therapist is trying to know the details of his social anxiety and fears around it. He seems more interested in knowing his cognition and his own mental image about himself than his current experience especially in the initial part of the session; speech patients speech was fluent and coherent as he was replying and obeying to what therapist was saying regarding the experiment; mood and affect as per this transcript its hard to say about his mood and affect, though he sounds concerned and embarrassed about his current problems he is facing in social situations; thought thoughts are coherent and logical; perception the individual holds a negative self-perception, believing they appear weird and out of place in social situations. They worry about appearing visibly anxious and fear saying something stupid; cognitive functions his attention span and concentration seems fine. He had an orientation of time and space. His memory also seems fine; judgement and insight he has an insight of his problem as he is able to explain all the details and understands it very well. His judgement is poor as its quite difficult for him to separate himself from his own imagined reality where he feels that if he wont clench his body then people will find him weird, out of the place and will see will his disturbed condition. ; Psychotherapy Type: Type cbt; mode individual ; Psychotherapy Technique : 1 reflective listening therapist is trying to give back whatever the patient is saying and making him think and listen to what he is saying. 2 thought challenging- here therapist tried to challenge his thought about his experience of anxiety and asked him to participate in the experiment to see whether he can experience any change in his body. 3 cognitive restructuring- here after the experiment, therapist pointed out a change in his behaviour during the experiment and asked him to rate his anxiety again which helped in restructuring his cognition. ; Assessments: Nil ; Issues discussed in Current Session: There are few issues discussed in the session which are as follows 1. Social anxiety the first theme can be seen is that the patient experiences significant anxiety about how they come across in social situations, particularly at work. This anxiety manifests in physical symptoms such as shaking, sweating, and blushing. 2. Behavioural experiment the therapist introduced an experiment to challenge patients beliefs about their social performance in which they do a role play of a work conversation twice, once with their usual coping mechanisms and once without using anything. 3. Reality check this experiment helped him to challenge his reality and see it objectively. It was discovered that his anxiety symptoms are less severe than anticipated and that he can engage in a conversation more naturally when he tries to minimise or stops his coping strategies. 4. Changed perception the video in the experiment made him see and reevaluates his perceptions of his performance. He can see a visible change in his anxiety and noticed that it was not as evident to others as he had feared. This made him realise that he can be more effective in his communication when he does not try to change or control himself. Copying mechanisms gripping onto objects tightly, avoiding eye contact, and wearing black clothes to hide sweating. ; Reflections by the therapist: Nil ; Clinical Diagnosis by Reviewer: Social anxiety ; Action Plan : Nil ; Next session details: Nil",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Andy, do you want to come on in and have a seat? ; Therapist: I'm Dr Taylor, I'm the on-call psychiatrist for this afternoon. ; Therapist: I got a call this morning from your family doctor, because I think you went to see him this morning along with your mum, and I gather that things have been a little bit difficult for you, you've had some other distressing experiences, so I think your doctor thought it might be helpful for us to have a bit of a discussion about that, to see if I could help. ; Therapist: Would that be alright with you? ; Patient: No, it's fine. ; Therapist: Would it be alright Andy for you to tell me a little bit about what's been going on? ; Patient: Well, you're going to think it sounds stupid, but my housemates are working for MI5, and they're doing stuff to my brain, and they're out to get me. ; Therapist: OK, that must be very difficult for you. ; Therapist: How long has this been going on for Andy? ; Patient: About two months. ; Therapist: And how did you first work out that this was happening? ; Patient: I came home one time and moved the TV to the other side of the room, and I knew then. ; Therapist: What was it that you knew at that moment? ; Patient: That they were for MI5. ; Therapist: Right, OK. ; Therapist: So it's been going on a couple of months? ; Patient: Yeah, this new lecturer started at uni, and he worked for MI5, and he basically drafted me housemates in, turned them against me. ; Therapist: OK, OK. ; Therapist: Now I've noticed a couple of times while we've been talking that you've sort of looked round you into the room as if you're checking for something. ; Therapist: Could I ask you what's happening at those times? ; Patient: Well, I can hear them talking about me. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Who is it you can hear? ; Patient: My housemates. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So that you recognise it as their voices? ; Patient: Yeah, I can hear them all the time. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: How many voices can you hear, Andy? ; Patient: Three, there's three of them. ; Therapist: OK, and do they sound real, like my voice sounds, talking to you now? ; Patient: Yeah, it's odd. ; Patient: It's like I can hear them when they're not here. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So when they're not in the house with you? ; Patient: Yeah, it's like they're in the other room or something. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And can you hear what they're actually saying? ; Patient: Yeah, they're talking about me. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: They're always talking about me. ; Patient: They're always commenting on everything that I'm doing. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Can you give me an example of what they would say? ; Patient: Well, like if I'm packing me back to go to uni or something, they'll comment on that, like you've left the house now. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Anything else? ; Therapist: Do they ever talk to each other, perhaps, about you? ; Patient: Yeah, that's what they do. ; Patient: I mean, and now they know the sort of twig that I know about them now. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: They're saying like I'm making trouble. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: And that they're going to sort me out. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: What about actually talking directly to you in the way that I'm talking to you now? ; Therapist: Does that ever happen, Andy? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So you've been hearing the voices of your housemates. ; Therapist: Have there been any other changes? ; Therapist: Have there been any changes, perhaps, to the way you're thinking? ; Therapist: Sometimes people tell us that they're thinking changes in some way. ; Therapist: So, for example, they might feel that they're getting thoughts put into their head that aren't their own. ; Therapist: Have you had any experiences like that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I do think things that aren't me. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: Like they're putting stuff in my brain. ; Patient: It's not me. ; Patient: I'm not thinking. ; Therapist: So different thoughts in your brain. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's stupid stuff as well. ; Patient: It's like the other day I suddenly just started thinking about some woman in Carnation Street. ; Patient: I don't watch any of that crap. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: It's not your kind of thing normally. ; Patient: They're not my thoughts. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And do you have any idea how that's happening? ; Therapist: Or who's responsible? ; Patient: It's MI5. ; Patient: It's this chip they're putting in my head. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: And I can feel it all the time. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So you're getting thoughts put into your brain that aren't your own. ; Therapist: What about a different sort of experience? ; Therapist: What about the experience that somehow other people are able to know what you're thinking even though you haven't actually told them? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Nothing like that? ; Patient: They're just putting stuff in my head. ; Therapist: Just putting stuff. ; Therapist: And can I just check Andy as well that you're not getting the experience when your thoughts just stop altogether like you have no thoughts left? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: If anything, there's too much in there. ; Patient: I wish I could unplug it. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: Just get this thing out of my head. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And you mentioned this chip or this device in your brain. ; Therapist: Do you want to tell me a bit more about that? ; Patient: Well, it's a tracking device so they know where I am at all times and I can feel it moving around, like rotating around. ; Therapist: So you can feel the physical sensation in your brain? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: That must be very difficult for you. ; Patient: I don't know why they're doing this to me. ; Patient: I've done nothing wrong. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Can I just check? ; Therapist: Are there any problems, Andy, with the rest of your body? ; Therapist: Any changes in sensation or any bits that feel different in any way? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I feel fine. ; Patient: I'm not ill or anything. ; Patient: I just want this thing out of my head. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: It sounds like a very difficult time for you. ; Therapist: Can I ask you, Andy, how are you coping with all this? ; Therapist: How is it affecting you? ; Patient: Well, I know we're leaving my room much and I sort of have to wait until they go out to go down and get some food. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: But they've been doing stuff to my food now. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: What do you think is happening to your food? ; Patient: The poison in it. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Are you actually eating much at the moment? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Now, with all this happening, and this sounds like you don't feel very safe, have I got that right? ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Have you felt the need, I don't know, to take steps to protect yourself in any way? ; Patient: Well, I've got a knife. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: And I've got like a baseball bat. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: It's just in case they get in my room. ; Patient: I just don't want to hurt anyone. ; Patient: I just feel like I've got to protect myself. ; Patient: It's like cornering me to do this. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Have you felt the need to use either the knife or the baseball bat so far? ; Therapist: I'll take it out with you for protection. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No, I don't want to get caught. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: It's just in my room. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Has it ever got so bad, Andy, that you've felt the need to hurt yourself or even kill yourself as the only way out, the only way of coping with this? ; Patient: Well, I thought about getting some pills, but I couldn't leave the house, so I didn't get anything. ; Therapist: And when you say getting some pills, would that be to take an overdose of tablets? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: But you've not actually done anything about that so far. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: In the past, have you ever had any problems either with your temper or getting into fights, being aggressive, either with your housemates or anybody else? ; Patient: No, I'm not that kind of person. ; Patient: I don't want to hurt anybody. ; Patient: They're just driving me to this. ; Therapist: And can I just check again? ; Therapist: You've not been in trouble with the police or anything like that? ; Patient: No, never. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: With all this that's going on, is there anywhere at the moment, Andy, that you feel safe? ; Patient: My parents' house. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And have you seen much of your parents recently? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I thought about going back there, but I don't want to drag them into this. ; Patient: I don't want them or if I've known about them. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And throughout this last couple of months, when you've had all these worries, have you ever worried that your parents might in some way be involved in this? ; Patient: I thought about it, but no. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Can I just check out a couple of background things with you, Andy? ; Therapist: You're general health. ; Therapist: Is that OK? ; Therapist: You generally fit and well? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I'm not ill. ; Patient: There's nothing wrong with me. ; Patient: It's just this thing in my head. ; Therapist: And you're not on any regular medication from your own doctor at this stage? ; Patient: No, I don't take any pills. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: What about other drugs? ; Therapist: And by that I'm meaning alcohol, cannabis, pills, anything else? ; Patient: I don't drink much alcohol. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: And what about drugs like cannabis? ; Patient: Is my mum going to know about this? ; Therapist: No, I think it's something that's important that I hear about, but this wouldn't be something we'd be discussing with your mum. ; Patient: I smoke a bit of weed. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Would that be regularly for most days? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how much would you be spending on weed? ; Patient: I get like a ten bag, it lasts me a day or so. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: So you have a ten bag lasting you a day of weed. ; Therapist: Any other drugs? ; Therapist: I'm thinking in particular things like speed or pills. ; Patient: I've done a bit of speed. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Is that on a regular basis, Andy? ; Patient: I was grabbing my mates for the weekend, we'd do a bit, but... ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: When was the last time, Andy, that you would have had any speed? ; Patient: About a week or so ago. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Any other drugs at all? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: No. ; Patient: But I know what you're getting at, though. ; Patient: It's not the drugs. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: This is... It doesn't matter how out my face I get, this is constantly there, it's always there. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: I guess the reason I was checking, I think is what you've picked up on, is that sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are, they find if they take certain drugs it can make things feel a lot worse. ; Therapist: I just wanted to check if that hadn't been your experience. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: I appreciate from what you're saying that you're really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that that's the cause of the difficulties that you're having at the moment. ; Therapist: I just wanted to check with you. ; Therapist: Do you think it could be due to anything else? ; Therapist: I mean, I've obviously met other people who've had similar experiences and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be actually mentally unwell. ; Therapist: And just whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Because I'm not ill. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: It's them and I've read books on this as well. ; Patient: I don't... The government know about them. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: They know that they do this to loads of people. ; Patient: I don't know how they can get away with it. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: OK. ; Patient: I've done nothing wrong. ; Patient: I don't know why they're doing this to me. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: I just want it... I just want it to stop. ; Therapist: OK. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: And I think I can appreciate that. ; Therapist: I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor, that sometimes meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful. ; Therapist: Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, I'm only here really because I'm a warm-up. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: I've tried to... I don't want to worry her. ; Patient: I've tried to talk to her about it and she doesn't understand. ; Patient: She doesn't really believe me. ; Patient: I mean... ; Patient: Do you believe me? ; Therapist: Well, I certainly believe that you're having a really difficult time at the moment. ; Therapist: I guess what I'm not as sure about is what's causing this and I'm less sure this is due to MI5. ; Therapist: I guess what I'm wondering is that perhaps you're not as well as you might be at the moment. ; Therapist: I mean, we've been through a lot of questions and what I'm thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this. ; Therapist: So I'm wondering, because I know your mum is... I think she's waiting in the waiting room. ; Therapist: It might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some proper support. ; Therapist: Would that be alright if I got your mum in? ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: If you want to sit there then, Andy, I'll just get your mum. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Okay.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Sharon, how are you doing today? ; Patient: Well, I'm alright. ; Patient: My counselor, you know, my counselor sent me over because she's a little worried about me that I might hurt myself. ; Therapist: She's a little worried about you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: What does she think is going to happen? ; Patient: I mean, I don't know, I guess she thinks that, I guess the things that I'm thinking are dangerous. ; Therapist: You mind if I do an assessment to measure your risk of harm? ; Patient: That's fine. ; Therapist: Okay, alright. ; Therapist: Sharon, how old are you? ; Patient: 28 ; Therapist: Now, think about your family for a moment. ; Therapist: Is there any history of suicide or any type of suicidal behavior in your family? ; Patient: Yeah, my dad committed suicide. ; Therapist: Your father committed suicide? ; Therapist: Any other? ; Patient: I mean, I think that my sister has had an attempt. ; Therapist: Attempt? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: How long ago did your father commit suicide? ; Patient: Like 15 years ago, I think. ; Therapist: 15 years ago? ; Patient: Yeah, something like that. ; Therapist: How many think about that? ; Patient: I try not to think about it. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: That must be hard though. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's hard. ; Therapist: Is that on your mind now? ; Patient: No, that we're talking about it, yes. ; Therapist: Is that on your mind before we talk about it? ; Patient: Not really, no, not really. ; Therapist: Are there any mental health disorders that you're aware of in your family or that you suspect in your family? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean, I don't know. ; Therapist: You're not aware of any? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about any disorders you've been diagnosed with? ; Patient: Well right now I think that I've been diagnosed with depression and in the past I've had some problems with anxiety. ; Therapist: And how about now? ; Patient: How about now, am I having problems with anxiety? ; Patient: Not as bad as in the past. ; Therapist: And how about depression? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right now? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And how bad? ; Patient: Pretty bad. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst it's ever been, how depressed are you ; Patient: now? ; Patient: Probably like an eight or a nine. ; Therapist: Eight or a nine. ; Therapist: That's depressed. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How about anxiety at the same scale? ; Patient: Probably like a four or a five. ; Therapist: Four or five. ; Therapist: So not quite as bad anxiety? ; Patient: Not as bad as it's been, but it's getting up there. ; Therapist: It's getting worse lately? ; Patient: Yeah, I think it'll be, yeah. ; Patient: It's been worse lately. ; Therapist: So if you were to think back, say a couple days ago, how bad was the anxiety and depression? ; Patient: Anxiety, probably like a three or a four. ; Patient: Depression about an eight or a nine. ; Patient: Still, same. ; Therapist: Same intensity? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do you have any medical illnesses? ; Patient: Um, no. ; Therapist: None? ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you live alone? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You do? ; Therapist: How often do you see your relatives? ; Patient: Probably see my relatives like every, like maybe once a month maybe. ; Therapist: How about friends? ; Patient: Friends, it depends. ; Patient: Not as much lately. ; Patient: Um, I used to be better friends with my coworkers and I lost my job so I haven't seen them as much and so probably maybe like once a week maybe. ; Therapist: Once a week? ; Patient: Depends on the week. ; Therapist: How long ago did you lose your child? ; Patient: About, uh, two months ago. ; Therapist: Two months ago? ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that happen to you. ; Therapist: How would you characterize the strength of your social network? ; Therapist: Like is it as strong as you want it to be? ; Patient: No, sometimes I feel pretty alone. ; Therapist: Do you? ; Patient: Yeah, I feel like, you know, nobody really wants me around, nobody really needs me, so yeah, I feel pretty alone a lot of the time. ; Patient: Sometimes even when I'm with other people. ; Therapist: So you're with people and you still feel isolated? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: When you are with people and you're not feeling isolated, how would you characterize the quality of the relationships you have? ; Therapist: Let's start with your family. ; Therapist: How good do you think those relationships are? ; Patient: Um, I mean, they're okay, like not really that great, but everybody has like trouble with their family I guess, so I don't know. ; Therapist: You think it was more or less normal? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Therapist: How about with your friends? ; Patient: It's okay. ; Patient: You know, I guess I'm always like second guessing everything, like do they really like me? ; Patient: Do they really want to spend time with me? ; Patient: I know I'm bothering them, that kind of thing, but I mean it's not, for the most part, I mean I think they care about me. ; Patient: It's a pretty, you know, we have a good time I think when we're together for the most part, but. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: For the most part, positive? ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Do you have any conflict or crisis going on right now? ; Therapist: You mentioned the loss of your job. ; Patient: Yeah, um, I'm going to be evicted from my house or, you know, my apartment because I can't pay my bills because I lost my job, so I really don't know what I'm going to do or where I'm going to go. ; Patient: I just don't know what to do. ; Patient: I'm feeling really lost and like helpless and like everything's just pointless. ; Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. ; Therapist: When are you going to be evicted? ; Patient: Um, well I'm not quite sure. ; Patient: Um, it sounds like it's going to be at the end of the month. ; Therapist: So at the end of the month you're going to be evicted from the house or apartment? ; Patient: It's an apartment. ; Patient: Apartment. ; Therapist: And when did you find this out? ; Patient: Um, well, you know, before I lost my job I had had some trouble paying the rent as it was, so, um, you know, the last time I missed my rent was probably like a month and a half ago. ; Patient: My landlord kind of told me that I couldn't live there anymore but I didn't know, you know, how much stock to put in that and now at the beginning of the month he said, you know, you have to, you're going to have to get out of here. ; Therapist: You're going to be evicted. ; Patient: We're going to change the locks. ; Therapist: Alright, so it's all fairly recent. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I guess that's why I'm having more anxiety than before because like it feels really out of control and I don't know what is going to happen, like when he's going to do it, you know, for sure and how, you know, what I'm going to do, so. ; Therapist: There's a lot of uncertainty around when it's going to happen and then what's going to happen to you. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: Have you in the past thought about suicide? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about how many times or about how often? ; Patient: Probably like every time I get depressed like this I, you know, have those thoughts so I ; Patient: don't know. ; Therapist: I mean, how often. ; Patient: That's a really hard question. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: Have you ever attempted to commit suicide? ; Patient: Yeah, one time, probably like four years ago. ; Therapist: What did you do? ; Patient: I cut my wrists but it wasn't, you know, nothing really happened. ; Patient: Like I just put a, I just wrapped them up. ; Patient: It wasn't really that bad. ; Therapist: You didn't go to the hospital or anything? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Have you ever thought about committing suicide and were about to attempt and stopped? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Like when you make a plan? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: How many times has that happened? ; Patient: Um, maybe like three or four. ; Patient: It's hard to remember because sometimes it's a long time ago but more recently, like maybe once or twice at least. ; Therapist: So once or twice in the recent past? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you ever injured yourself intentionally? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about that? ; Patient: Well, there was that time that I tried to commit suicide and then there have been times before that where I like, you know, kind of like tested the waters, like, you know, just cut myself a little bit to see what it would be like and that kind of thing. ; Therapist: When's the last time you've done that? ; Patient: Um, it would be the last time I tried to commit suicide, like that time I was telling you about it because it really freaked me out. ; Patient: So I don't think I would try that again. ; Therapist: You don't think you'd try that again? ; Patient: Not like cutting myself. ; Therapist: Not cutting, okay. ; Therapist: Have you ever been abused physically, sexually, emotionally? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: You don't know? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I guess like I had a really hard childhood with my mom and everything and that's part of the reason why being evicted is so scary because I really don't want to move back in with her. ; Patient: You know, we got in a lot of fights and it was just a really bad environment and I really, really, really, really don't want to go live with her. ; Therapist: So if you get evicted, you're worried you'd have to live with your mother? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you guys had a rough time in the past? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You don't want to repeat that? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I don't want to live like that. ; Therapist: What is your attitude towards suicide? ; Therapist: What are your feelings about suicide as a concept in general? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: I mean I guess it's really sad like nobody wants that, you know, whenever you hear somebody committed suicide everybody's really sad about it but sometimes it just feels like what else is there, you know? ; Patient: Like I don't know how I can go on like this. ; Patient: Like things just keep getting worse and worse and I don't know what to do. ; Patient: So I mean I'm sure like it's not a great thing but at the same time I don't know. ; Therapist: You disapprove of it but you're considering it because you're running out of options. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you ever been impulsive in the past? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: Like I guess not really because there have been times when I've like thought about committing suicide and getting really close and still haven't done it, you know? ; Patient: I have but in other areas other than suicide. ; Therapist: Are you generally impulsive? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Therapist: Ever violent or aggressive? ; Patient: Not really, no. ; Therapist: Have you ever experienced what we call hallucinations which would be like hearing things other people can't hear or seeing things other people can't see? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Therapist: You don't think so? ; Patient: No, I mean it's hard to tell what other people can't hear when no one's around to tell you whether they can hear it or not but I don't think that I have. ; Therapist: You're fairly certain you have it? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Can you tell me about any alcohol or drug use? ; Patient: Sometimes I drink, you know, alone when I'm in my house because like I said I don't see a lot of other people. ; Patient: I don't really do any drugs. ; Therapist: When's the last time you had a drink? ; Patient: Last night. ; Therapist: How much did you have? ; Patient: Probably like a bottle of wine. ; Therapist: A bottle of wine? ; Therapist: Is that typical for you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It is? ; Patient: It is? ; Therapist: How often would you say you drink a bottle of wine? ; Patient: Maybe like three or four times a week. ; Therapist: Three or four times a week? ; Therapist: So I want to ask you about the suicidal thoughts that you're having now. ; Therapist: How frequently are you having the thoughts? ; Patient: Like really often. ; Therapist: Yeah, kind of like all the time? ; Patient: Pretty much, yeah. ; Therapist: How intense would you say the thoughts are? ; Patient: Fairly intense, like it's scary the thought of it, you know, but at the same time like I'm having them so much it's, I don't know. ; Therapist: It's frightening for you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Do you have a plan laid out if you try to commit suicide? ; Patient: I guess I would just drink a bottle of wine like I usually do and then maybe take some pills. ; Therapist: What kind of pills? ; Patient: There's like ibuprofen in my medicine cabinet. ; Patient: That's like the only thing I have in there other than vitamins so I guess I just take that. ; Patient: I don't know how many but a lot I guess, I don't know. ; Therapist: So you drink a bottle of wine and take a lot of ibuprofen? ; Therapist: Do you have an intent to commit suicide? ; Therapist: Are you going to follow through? ; Patient: I don't know, like sometimes I think about it, I get really close to doing it but I, you know, I haven't like taken any pills so I guess yeah, like I think about it a lot and I've gotten close to doing it so yeah I guess yeah, I guess so. ; Therapist: So you feel like you have an intent?

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi Jason, how are you doing today? ; Therapist: I'm okay. ; Patient: I'm alright. ; Therapist: You're alright? ; Patient: I'm just here. ; Therapist: You're just here? ; Patient: Just here. ; Therapist: I understand that you were in the hospital a couple of weeks ago. ; Patient: Yeah, I was in the hospital about two weeks ago. ; Patient: I did something and I had to go to the hospital afterwards. ; Therapist: You tell me about it? ; Patient: Yeah, so about two weeks ago I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating in my room so that the government can't hear my thoughts or my actions or my behaviors and I was just trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build. ; Patient: I went over to the neighbor because their garage was open and I just picked out a tool and I brought it back to the house and when I was in the house working on my room, the cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital and I was just like, see, the government's at it again. ; Therapist: What do you think the government's trying to do? ; Patient: They're trying to stop me from actually creating my room because they're creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them and I'm not a follower. ; Patient: I know what I want and I know what I need and I know what my family wants and I know what they need and I'm just trying to protect them by creating my room. ; Therapist: And tell me about your room. ; Therapist: What are you doing there that makes that special? ; Patient: So I'm smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that the government is actually sending through the lights and also through the TV and through every electronic apparatus that is out there and I'm actually creating a doll or a wave neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening so that you can actually live the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time. ; Therapist: Is that how you were feeling when you were building it? ; Patient: Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room and any time I'm basically in there, it was good. ; Patient: I had energy. ; Patient: I did everything that I wanted but my prototype was running out of fuel and so I needed to make it bigger and larger so it can run longer. ; Therapist: That's what you're trying to do when you... ; Patient: Yeah, that's what I was trying to do when I wasn't borrowed the tools from my neighbor. ; Patient: And then also I was ordering some things that were online and they were also supposed to be shipped in so that the base piece that I was creating that I used the tools from my neighbor's house, it could have been all perfect and set so that when all of the hard drives and the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could just plug it in and then not only have my room covered but also my house is covered and then all of my family, they could just be happy. ; Therapist: They could be happy? ; Patient: They could be happy. ; Therapist: Like you were happy. ; Patient: Like I was happy. ; Patient: So two weeks ago, I was good. ; Patient: I was up. ; Patient: I did all the calculations that I needed to create so I could actually build my base and my system but then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house but then also out of the house. ; Patient: Then I also had the opportunity to just not sleep because who needs sleep? ; Patient: I wasn't tired. ; Patient: If I did sleep, I slept for like 15 minutes just because I needed to finish what I was going to do. ; Patient: I was so close to finishing and my neighbor called the cops. ; Therapist: So you had a period of time. ; Therapist: We had like a lot of energy and you weren't really sleeping much? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Did you need to... ; Patient: Doesn't everybody do that? ; Therapist: You were also happy and felt satisfied? ; Patient: I felt good. ; Patient: Like when I sleep, I don't like when I sleep because it just feels wrong. ; Patient: I'm not actually using my time wisely. ; Patient: So those last two weeks or two weeks ago, it was perfect. ; Patient: It was the best time of my life. ; Patient: Like I was living the same living life to your fullest. ; Patient: I was living life to my fullest then. ; Patient: It was perfect. ; Therapist: How do you feel now in comparison? ; Patient: I'm all right. ; Therapist: You're all right? ; Patient: I'm all right. ; Patient: Just all right right now. ; Patient: The government made me go on different medication. ; Patient: So just all right. ; Patient: Not that happy. ; Patient: Not that excited. ; Therapist: So not happy? ; Therapist: How about sad? ; Patient: No, I'm not sad either. ; Patient: It's just... ; Therapist: Kind of in the middle? ; Patient: In the middle. ; Therapist: Do you want to get back to that happiness? ; Patient: Of course. ; Patient: Who doesn't want to get back to the happiness of their life? ; Patient: That's the reason why I need to finish my machine. ; Therapist: The machine? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Now you mentioned you'd ordered some products online. ; Therapist: How much did you order? ; Patient: I think I ordered probably... ; Patient: No, the exact number. ; Patient: I ordered 236 hard drives because 236 is the perfect number that I needed to not only cover my bedroom so I could always be happy. ; Patient: And if the system went down, my room was always going to be covered. ; Patient: But then within that 236, it also covered my house so that my family could be happy. ; Patient: And my four neighbors were around us so we could all be happy. ; Patient: And that's the reason why I'm kind of angry at my one neighbor because I was including his house in on my grid so that he can also be happy all the time. ; Therapist: He would have been affected by your machine? ; Patient: Of course. ; Patient: He's the one that needs me. ; Patient: He helped me out. ; Patient: He let me borrow his tools. ; Patient: But evidently, he didn't let me borrow them this time. ; Patient: So I'm going to just pull him out. ; Patient: I'll have another neighbor take his place. ; Therapist: Were all those hard drives fairly expensive? ; Patient: I don't know. ; Patient: When I was up cleaning and running around the house trying to find more equipment, I found my mom's purse. ; Patient: And I was just like, oh my god, she has a credit card in there. ; Patient: Oh my god, I can use her credit card. ; Patient: So I was using her credit card because I was trying to make her happy. ; Patient: And so I don't know. ; Patient: I was at 236. ; Patient: They were probably $50 to $100 apiece, depending on where I could get them. ; Patient: And I just ordered them. ; Therapist: How did your mother respond to that? ; Patient: Well, my mom came to the hospital. ; Patient: I was just like, where are all these boxes coming from? ; Patient: I'm just like, just put them in my room with them. ; Patient: And she put them in my room. ; Patient: And then a week ago, she was just like, I see you use my credit card. ; Patient: She wasn't too happy with me. ; Therapist: Is that a strange relationship? ; Patient: No, that's just how my mom's relationship generally is. ; Therapist: You get along OK with it? ; Patient: We get along perfectly fine. ; Patient: That's how we talk to each other. ; Patient: We talk to each other literally because she's not in my room, so she's not happy. ; Patient: So any time she does come into my room, Beth is on the balance. ; Patient: So I get unhappy. ; Patient: And then I just tell her to stay out so that I can be happy and she can be happy in her own place. ; Therapist: And you mentioned that they changed your medications in the hospital. ; Patient: The government changed my medications. ; Therapist: The government? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: How are you feeling about taking your medications? ; Patient: Well, so the only reason I'm taking my medications now is because if I don't take them, then they're going to change them again. ; Patient: And then it's going to delay me in finishing my generator, my wave generator. ; Patient: And I need to finish my wave generator. ; Patient: So I'm taking them because I don't want the government to have more power over me, like they want to have power over everybody else. ; Patient: So I'm trying to avoid that. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So you really want to get back to working on that machine? ; Patient: Yes. ; Patient: I want to be back in my happy place. ; Therapist: Have you found yourself as motivated these last couple weeks as you were before you were hospitalized? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: I haven't been that motivated. ; Patient: I know I'm going to get it done. ; Patient: It's just I just don't know if I'm going to get it done today or tomorrow. ; Patient: But I know it's going to get done. ; Therapist: You still want to get that done. ; Therapist: It's important to you? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: It's really important to me because I ; Patient: can't be controlled by the government anymore. ; Therapist: All right, Jason. ; Therapist: I'd like you to continue seeing a counselor here. ; Therapist: Have you found the counseling to be helpful? ; Patient: The counseling has been OK. ; Therapist: It's been OK? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: I appreciate that they haven't been taking notes because I don't want that information to be leaked out. ; Patient: But it's been OK. ; Therapist: It's been OK? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: We'll continue with counseling. ; Therapist: And I hope that can help you a bit. ; Therapist: And I appreciate you spending this time with me and explaining what happened. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi there, Ms. ; Therapist: Stone. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Hi, I'm BJ Daniels. ; Therapist: Sorry, let me wash my hands. ; Patient: Just call me Dorothy. ; Therapist: Oh, thank you. ; Therapist: That's the next thing I was going to ask you. ; Therapist: So Dorothy, the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care. ; Therapist: But what's going on? ; Patient: Five days ago, I was admitted to emergency, and they treated me by putting this tube down my throat. ; Patient: And I tried to tell them and gesture to them that I don't want this tube down my throat. ; Patient: And I just hope that never happens again. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: No, I totally understand that. ; Therapist: I mean, that is quite a scary thing to go through. ; Therapist: And I think we do need to talk about this more, and I'm glad that you've asked to talk to me about this. ; Therapist: So I had a little bit of a look through your chart, so I think I understand why they did it. ; Therapist: But did anybody explain it to you? ; Patient: Well, not really, because I was gasping for air in the state I was. ; Patient: But I'll tell you what, I'm really worried that this won't happen to me again. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I don't want that tube anymore. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I'm okay to pass as I am. ; Therapist: Absolutely. ; Therapist: And you know what? ; Therapist: There's no right answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive like the tube. ; Therapist: We really want to know what the patient values in terms of things that are that invasive. ; Therapist: And so absolutely we'll respect whatever it is that you want. ; Therapist: But I do need to find out a little bit more about you in terms of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital? ; Patient: Well, I have congestive heart failure. ; Patient: And I guess there was water in my lungs and stopping me from breathing properly. ; Patient: So I was living in my, so the ambulance brought me in to the emergency. ; Patient: So that was how they were treating me. ; Therapist: So you pretty much showed up to emergency and very quickly they put that tube down. ; Patient: That's correct. ; Therapist: Did anybody ask you if you were okay with that? ; Patient: Well, I tried to gesture to them that I don't want the tube, but... ; Therapist: They didn't quite pick up on that. ; Patient: I guess not. ; Patient: And you know, I've had that three times already and I don't want to go through that again. ; Therapist: The tube you've had down three times? ; Patient: Yes, yes. ; Therapist: Oh wow, okay. ; Patient: Yes, I don't want it anymore. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And so you have congestive heart failure and it sounds like you've had a breathing problem. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And do you know why they would have put the tube down? ; Therapist: Do you know what they were trying to do? ; Patient: I guess because I was short of air. ; Patient: I had a hard time breathing. ; Patient: So they tried to, I'm going to use the word save me. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you understand that. ; Therapist: I mean, usually we only put a tube in if that was the only thing we could do to save you. ; Therapist: Most of the time a congestive heart failure will give some medications. ; Therapist: Have you heard of Lasix or furosemide? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: It's a medication we'll often give if someone is in heart failure. ; Therapist: But if someone is really sick and then we don't think we have time to give it, that's the time we would think of a breathing tube. ; Therapist: I haven't had chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in. ; Patient: I guess so. ; Patient: But I'm okay with dying. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: You know, like I said, I've lived a good life. ; Patient: And if the good Lord says that it's my time, I'm okay with that. ; Patient: And you wouldn't put a tube down my throat. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Already what I'm hearing from you, I'm just going to say exactly what you said. ; Therapist: It sounds like you've lived a good life. ; Therapist: You've been through this a few times. ; Therapist: You know exactly what it involves. ; Therapist: And if I could paraphrase to you, quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage. ; Therapist: Is that correct? ; Patient: That is correct. ; Patient: But you know what, Doctor? ; Patient: How can I be assured that my wishes are respected so I don't get this tube down? ; Therapist: That's an excellent question. ; Therapist: So first I did want to answer your previous question. ; Therapist: Based on what we're talking about, absolutely I agree with you that it is your wish and we will respect that wish, that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again. ; Therapist: And then of course your second question, which is great as well, is how do we make sure this doesn't happen? ; Patient: Absolutely, yeah. ; Therapist: So what I'm going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions to ask you, but after our conversation I write a note documenting what we talked about, that we talked about the breathing tube and your reasons for why you don't want it, which of course makes sense to me. ; Therapist: And then what I do is I document a short form called Goals of Care. ; Therapist: And I, just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds they know exactly what you want. ; Therapist: We will give you a copy of that to take home. ; Therapist: But I find that's not usually enough. ; Therapist: What we also do, what I do, is I tend to, when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor. ; Therapist: And that note's actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta. ; Therapist: And in that note it will very clearly state you and I had this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing tube. ; Therapist: So I'll reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that tube, okay? ; Patient: Oh, thank you. ; Patient: I was so concerned about that. ; Patient: And yes. ; Patient: I think I will rest now because, like I say, that was a horrendous experience and you said it won't happen again. ; Therapist: I do want to ask you just a few other questions related to this. ; Patient: Go ahead. ; Therapist: And the first question might sound a little off-putting, but I sort of have to ask it. ; Therapist: Anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want, we do have to ask, how is your mood? ; Therapist: How are you feeling? ; Patient: I'm feeling fine. ; Patient: My mood is fine. ; Patient: I have no problems. ; Therapist: Okay, excellent. ; Therapist: And how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital? ; Therapist: Like when you're healthy, as healthy as you can be, say a few weeks ago. ; Patient: I think I am enjoying life. ; Patient: Yes, I am enjoying life to the best I can. ; Therapist: Okay, great. ; Therapist: And then other related questions. ; Therapist: We did talk about the tube that we wouldn't put it in, but again, we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want. ; Therapist: So if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better, is that something you'd be willing to have? ; Patient: Certainly. ; Patient: Yes, I'll look at medication, just not the intubation. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And then usually along the lines with the intubation, when people don't want the intubation, we often also want to know if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck, you had passed away, or if someone just found you at home, you had passed away, would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks, trying to bring you back to life? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Patient: Like I said, the good Lord knows when it's my time. ; Therapist: No, and that all makes sense to me with the no breathing tube. ; Patient: Yes, and I have no problems with that. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: There are some other things we can do that's not a breathing tube, but they're a little aggressive. ; Therapist: And one is, have you ever heard of BiPAP? ; Patient: I don't think so. ; Therapist: It's a mask that really pushes air into you. ; Therapist: It's a little uncomfortable, but nothing as bad as a breathing tube. ; Therapist: It may be hard to answer this question because you don't know what that is, but do you have any thoughts on that? ; Therapist: If you were really sick, if we were to try just a mask, and we would do it just as long as you were okay with it and comfortable at the time. ; Patient: Would it be for a long time? ; Therapist: Not usually. ; Therapist: Most times with BiPAP, it's only about two to six hours for most patients. ; Patient: Yeah, that would be okay with me. ; Therapist: Okay, and if we had to put large IVs and lines into your wrist and stuff and take you to the intensive care unit, again, we wouldn't do breathing tube, but this is just to watch you closely? ; Patient: Yeah, I would be okay with that. ; Patient: Yes, yes. ; Patient: It doesn't sound invasive to me. ; Therapist: Alright, so let me just summarize. ; Therapist: I mean, it sounds like before you came into hospital, you know, life was pretty good. ; Therapist: I mean, it sounds like you've had some rough times with the heart failure. ; Therapist: We're very clear we do not want to put the breathing tube down. ; Patient: Absolutely. ; Therapist: But we're okay with medicines, we're okay with a mask, we wouldn't restart your heart. ; Therapist: I think that's pretty much everything I think I needed to hear, but is there anything else that you wanted to cover or talk about that I've missed? ; Patient: No, I just needed to be reassured that it won't happen again. ; Patient: And yeah, I know that on my chart, it's there. ; Therapist: Yes, yes. ; Patient: And that's all I need to hear because I was concerned. ; Therapist: Okay, I do want to say that this is not set in stone in the sense that if you ever change your mind, we can have the conversation again. ; Therapist: But if we don't hear from you, this is what we'll go with. ; Therapist: No breathing tube, no restarting the heart. ; Therapist: I just want you to know that in case anything were to change. ; Patient: Okay, so if I change my mind, I can, I will talk to you. ; Therapist: Absolutely. ; Patient: I don't think I'll change my mind. ; Therapist: I don't think you will either, but it's just nice to, so that you're aware of that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Honestly, I mean, there's some other questions I tend to ask people when I don't know them well, just kind of routine stuff. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And maybe we'll just quickly go through it. ; Patient: Go ahead. ; Therapist: Your medical history is the heart failure, anything else? ; Patient: That's it. ; Patient: I'm beginning with an S, but I can't remember what it is. ; Therapist: Okay, that's okay. ; Therapist: We can, usually we have it written down. ; Therapist: Your medications, I think I saw, you're on aspirin and digoxin, I think two others. ; Therapist: Do you happen to know or have them written down? ; Patient: You know what, I always carry this paper with me, because I can't remember the names. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Oh, so you are on the water pill, the furosemide. ; Patient: Oh, okay. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: And then those high some. ; Patient: Okay, great. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Any allergies? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And I won't ask about anything that runs in your family, given your age. ; Therapist: They told me you're 70, is that correct? ; Patient: That is correct, yes. ; Therapist: And I do have to ask the following questions, completely unrelated to what we're talking about. ; Patient: That's okay. ; Therapist: Do you smoke at all? ; Patient: No, I don't. ; Therapist: Do you drink any alcohol? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And this will sound crazy, but I have to ask, any street drugs, illegal drugs, anything like that? ; Patient: No, I never had the opportunity. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And I don't want to ask. ; Therapist: Any over-the-counter herbals in addition to these? ; Patient: No, I don't take any of those. ; Therapist: And where are you living right now? ; Patient: I'm living in a convalescent home for the last six months. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: I used to live in my own home, and six months ago I moved to a convalescent home. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And how do you feel about that, with that change six months ago? ; Patient: I would really prefer my own home. ; Patient: But just trouble with my breathing sometimes. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: So are you feeling better about being in that place now, their new home? ; Patient: It's okay. ; Patient: I really have to adjust. ; Patient: Like I say, if I had my druthers, I'd go back, but I guess I have to learn to adjust to this. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So I think I sort of have all the information I need to make sure that your wishes are respected. ; Therapist: Just one last time, anything else that you want to talk about today? ; Patient: Oh, you answered my question. ; Patient: I was so worried about this tube. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Well, it was very nice to meet you, Mr. Tillman. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: See you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: I guess I'm okay. ; Patient: How are you? ; Therapist: I'm well, thanks for asking. ; Therapist: So you say you're doing okay? ; Therapist: What's going on? ; Patient: Um, just definitely no better than last week when we talked. ; Patient: I mean, it's been, I had some major binges this week and I don't even honestly know why we're bothering to talk about it because I've been down this road before. ; Patient: I should just give up and buy some moo moos and you know, just resign myself to the fact that I'm going to get fat and I'm going to stay fat. ; Therapist: Tell me about some of the foods that you've been eating that have been kind of leading ; Patient: to this problem for you. ; Patient: Brownies. ; Patient: Mm-hmm. ; Patient: Brownies, brownies, brownies. ; Patient: And well, that's what got it started. ; Patient: You know, I was great the first half of the week and I was staying away from the sugar, away from the flour. ; Patient: My son just stayed home from school. ; Patient: You know, he hurt his head. ; Patient: He wanted to bake brownies. ; Patient: So I'm like, well, it's my son. ; Patient: Okay, let's bake brownies. ; Patient: So then we ate the whole pan and we baked two more pans and then it didn't just stay the brownies. ; Patient: So we went out and I had hamburgers, french fries, candy, you know, stopped in, voila, on the way back. ; Patient: Oh, it's disgusting. ; Patient: I don't want to tell you how much because it's disgusting and my clothes aren't fitting. ; Patient: It's just really, really sad. ; Therapist: You've had a rough week. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So let's talk about for a second, I'd like to, kind of your relationship to this problem. ; Therapist: How do you view this problem? ; Patient: It's disgusting. ; Patient: It's like, it's slavery. ; Patient: Food owns me. ; Therapist: So the food is in control of the situation. ; Patient: Sounds ridiculous when you say it like that, but that's what it is. ; Therapist: It's in control. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So I want to ask you a couple of questions about the importance and the confidence of changing. ; Therapist: Clearly, you have some desire to change or you wouldn't be here. ; Patient: Oh my God, I would love to, yeah. ; Therapist: So if you're looking at a scale of one to ten, one was, it's not important to change. ; Therapist: Ten was, it's extremely important to change. ; Therapist: This is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating. ; Patient: Ten. ; Therapist: Ten. ; Therapist: So very important to you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: It's very important. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So what if I ask the same question except this time you're confident. ; Therapist: So one is you're not confident all you can change, but ten, you're very confident you could change. ; Patient: I could probably change for half a day. ; Patient: I've done it. ; Patient: Sometimes if I'm lucky, I'll get a week, but overall? ; Patient: Overall. ; Patient: It's impossible. ; Patient: Like, you want a number? ; Patient: It's zero. ; Therapist: So it's below the scale of one to ten. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you have no confidence at all. ; Patient: I've tried it. ; Patient: I know. ; Patient: I mean, it's like beating my head against a wall. ; Therapist: So on one hand, you'd like to stop the eating. ; Therapist: It's important to you. ; Therapist: But on the other hand, you don't believe you can do it. ; Patient: I can't do it. ; Therapist: You can't do it. ; Patient: I can't. ; Patient: It can't be done. ; Therapist: Have there been any other changes you have been able to make, say, in the last few years that have been positive? ; Patient: I stopped biting my nails. ; Therapist: So you've had some small successes in terms of making changes. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: What do you think makes this, well, I'll just refer to it as the food problem, so much more powerful, so much more difficult to tackle? ; Patient: I wish I knew. ; Patient: I mean, there's so many things. ; Patient: It's everywhere. ; Therapist: The food is everywhere? ; Patient: Food is everywhere. ; Therapist: And, I mean. ; Therapist: You mentioned before that brownies were the culprit for this last week. ; Patient: Brownies, Hershey bars, Hershey kisses, yeah, chocolate. ; Therapist: You enjoy chocolate. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: How about other foods that could be contributing to the problem that maybe you don't enjoy as much as chocolate? ; Patient: Oh, potato chips, french fries, Mexican food, what else? ; Patient: Cheese, definitely. ; Therapist: Any other types of candies? ; Therapist: Start naming them. ; Patient: Skittles, Cherry Starburst, basically any candy. ; Therapist: Pretty much any candy. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, of the candies, so I want to focus just on the candies. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: And not the other foods just for now. ; Therapist: The thought of, like if I introduced the idea of stopping eating chocolate, how would you react to that? ; Patient: Not going to happen. ; Therapist: That's not going to happen. ; Therapist: All right. ; Patient: I would love for it to happen. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: But that's not going to happen. ; Patient: I can just tell you. ; Patient: I don't even want to pretend. ; Therapist: So you know that for certain. ; Therapist: How about the, let's go for example with the Skittles. ; Therapist: What if I introduced the idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles? ; Patient: Just the candy Skittles? ; Therapist: Just that one candy, yeah. ; Patient: Why, bother? ; Patient: That, like can I not eat Skittles? ; Patient: Is that what you're saying? ; Therapist: Well, you could, it's up to you whether you eat them or not. ; Therapist: But if I introduced that idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles, how would you react to that? ; Patient: I don't really understand why. ; Therapist: Well, it represents a change in the direction that you want to move. ; Patient: But if I stop eating Skittles, I'm still going to eat brownies. ; Patient: I'm still going to eat, you know. ; Therapist: But we know that's an area that you can't really make a change right now from what you're saying. ; Therapist: That's the idea of stopping chocolate is not going over well with you. ; Patient: No, it's not going to happen. ; Therapist: And that's fine. ; Therapist: But the idea of stopping Skittles. ; Patient: That's fine. ; Therapist: That doesn't seem as daunting. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: Would you agree still on say the one to ten scale that it's important to stop Skittles? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: I mean, I think that's a change that you could not eat them. ; Patient: Well, it's kind of funny now that you're talking about it. ; Patient: I sort of want Skittles more. ; Patient: But, you know, like from now until next week when I come in here, I'd say like I'm 99% confident I could not eat Skittles and it would not be a major problem. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So this is a change that you think you could accomplish. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Even though you're not sure it will actually contribute to solving the larger problem, we know that that's something that, that's an area where you don't really see a change as likely. ; Patient: Like this continued chocolate. ; Patient: If I don't eat Skittles this week or even for the rest of my life, is it going to solve my problem? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: But will I do it if that's what you want me to do? ; Patient: Yeah, that's fine. ; Therapist: Well, I would hope it's something that, that you would want to do. ; Therapist: I mean, what I want is one thing. ; Therapist: What you want is really important here. ; Therapist: Is this something that, I mean, are Skittles part of the problem? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Small. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right? ; Therapist: No pun intended, right? ; Therapist: Even though they're small. ; Therapist: But it's a small part of the problem, but you would agree it's still part of the problem? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Therapist: Not a huge change, but it's one that we can work on. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: I mean, I want you to be able to, you know, genuinely buy into the goal. ; Therapist: I mean, if you don't think it's important, we can talk about other areas of change. ; Patient: No, I guess I see what you're saying. ; Patient: I mean, if I'm going to be completely honest with you, I, ; Patient: I think it's going to work. ; Patient: Well, that's what I'm paying you for, right? ; Patient: So, I don't think it's going to work. ; Patient: I'll just tell you that. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: You think you could stop eating Skittles, but you don't think it's going to solve the larger problem or lead to? ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: But that's what we have to work with right now, because the larger problem is not something, you know, I mean, the way you put it is it has control. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: Right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, if I introduced the idea of stopping brownies. ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: No. ; Therapist: Sorry. ; Therapist: So, let's, let's go after the change that we can achieve in this case. ; Therapist: You know, it's not perfect, it's not ideal, but it's what you can do. ; Patient: Fair enough. ; Therapist: Sound, sound like a plan? ; Therapist: So, so for this week, I'll see you again in a week. ; Therapist: For this week, just, just continue eating Skittles. ; Patient: No Skittles. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: No Skittles. ; Therapist: And let's see, let's see how we do with that change. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Fair enough. ; Therapist: Does that seem to make sense? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, we'll work with that and I'll see you again in a week. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: Thanks again. ; Therapist: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Come in. ; Therapist: Mrs. Olsen. ; Patient: Hello Doctor. ; Therapist: Hello I'm Doctor O'Connor. ; Therapist: Would you like to take a seat? ; Patient: Yes thank you. ; Therapist: How are you today? ; Patient: Oh Doctor I've not been feeling very well at all. ; Patient: Feeling really tired and run down and I've been having this breathlessness you know and I've really been worried about it. ; Therapist: You came in to see one of my colleagues about that recently didn't you? ; Patient: I did yes. ; Therapist: And she sent you for a blood test. ; Patient: That's right Doctor. ; Therapist: We think you might be anaemic. ; Patient: Oh gosh yes. ; Therapist: So what I want to do today was firstly to give you your blood test results and then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anaemia and then talk about some potential treatments. ; Patient: Oh right Doctor yes. ; Therapist: Does that ; Therapist: sound ok with you? ; Patient: That sounds fine yes Doctor. ; Therapist: Great so shall we have a look at your blood test results? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Here it is. ; Therapist: So what we're testing for is the level of haemoglobin in your blood. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And just to show you the normal range for women is between 11.5 and 16 grams per deciliter of haemoglobin. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And this is your level of haemoglobin it's 8.7. ; Patient: Oh that's low isn't it? ; Therapist: It's a bit lower than we would like. ; Therapist: Oh dear yes. ; Therapist: So what we'll be looking to do is to get that back within the normal range. ; Therapist: Right ok. ; Therapist: Just to reassure you iron deficiency anaemia which I think you've got is fairly common up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anaemia. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And it's very treatable as well. ; Therapist: Yes ; Patient: yeah yeah. ; Patient: Oh yes I mean this tiredness that's just getting me down Doctor. ; Therapist: It must be it must be because you've got quite a busy lifestyle haven't you? ; Patient: I have yes yeah and I just feel as though I can't cope much longer with it. ; Therapist: Ok. ; Therapist: Shall I tell you a bit more about anaemia? ; Therapist: Do you know anything about the condition? ; Patient: I don't know I mean I've heard of it but I don't know what it is. ; Therapist: Well it's a condition related to your blood. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And within your blood there's several components one of which is plasma. ; Therapist: Within the plasma you have your red blood cells. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And within that you have a protein called haemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs. ; Therapist: Ok. ; Therapist: Now if that's not working efficiently you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you've been having like breathlessness, tiredness. ; Patient: Yeah definitely. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: One of the causes can be blood loss so I wondered about your periods how are they? ; Patient: Well they've been heavy these last few months really heavy yeah. ; Patient: I've put it down to my age you know they start getting irregular and heavy and but you might ; Therapist: be right there yes. ; Therapist: That may be a factor. ; Therapist: Yeah yeah. ; Therapist: So I want to talk to you about treatments now. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Therapist: There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try. ; Therapist: The first thing we'd like you to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet. ; Therapist: Can you tell me a bit about this sort of diet you have at the moment? ; Patient: Well I mean I'm really busy and I think they have a reasonable you know a well-balanced diet. ; Patient: We eat a lot of ready meals and then on a weekend we always have a good breakfast it was cooked bacon butters. ; Therapist: No so ; Patient: I think it's quite quite a good diet. ; Therapist: Right with your teenage children they keep you busy. ; Patient: Oh they do yes I mean you know it's like having a taxi service you what with that and and then at work you know so busy at work it's just just so tired. ; Patient: Mmm just keep feeling tired it must be hard for ; Therapist: you to do all those things. ; Therapist: Yes yeah it's difficult though it just feels like I can't cope anymore. ; Therapist: Yeah now you mentioned ready meals I can understand you relying on those for convenience but the problem is sometimes you don't get the proper balance of nutrients. ; Therapist: All right doctor. ; Therapist: So what I'd ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet. ; Therapist: Oh right okay. ; Therapist: Before I tell you about what some of those foods are can I ask if you're a vegetarian? ; Patient: No no. ; Therapist: You're not. ; Therapist: The reason I ask that is because one of the best sources of iron in your diet is lean red meat. ; Therapist: Oh yes yeah yeah like steak. ; Therapist: Yeah exactly. ; Patient: Also liver is a good source. ; Patient: Oh no no no no no no couldn't eat liver. ; Therapist: What about something like steak that you mentioned would you consider eating that a bit more regularly? ; Patient: Well yes I mean steak wouldn't take long to cook would it at all? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: You could give that a go. ; Therapist: Good good. ; Therapist: There's also leafy green vegetables things like kale and spinach are good sources of iron. ; Patient: Oh the kids wouldn't eat that. ; Patient: But I mean they like sweet corn so they can have the sweet corn couldn't they with the green vegetables. ; Patient: I could go for the leafy the green vegetables. ; Therapist: Do you think you could give that a try? ; Patient: Broccoli. ; Patient: So it's broccoli. ; Patient: Yes broccoli. ; Patient: Yeah I like broccoli. ; Therapist: Oh good good. ; Patient: I'll have a go with that. ; Therapist: There's other things too you might want to consider things like fortified cereals which have iron. ; Patient: Oh right what are those? ; Therapist: Well if you look on the ingredients panel of cereals you'll see some are enriched with iron so you could perhaps incorporate some of those. ; Patient: Oh yes yes I'll have a look at the supermarket. ; Patient: If I got some of those we could have that at weekend and that give me more time I wouldn't have to cook would I? ; Therapist: It could make your life a bit easier. ; Therapist: Yeah definitely. ; Therapist: That would be a help wouldn't it? ; Therapist: It would yes. ; Therapist: Wholemeal bread is a good source of iron as well. ; Patient: Oh yes you know they only like white bread only them they buy white bread but I could buy myself some brown bread cobs and have it for lunch. ; Therapist: Yes yeah. ; Therapist: Oh good. ; Therapist: So do you think you could give some of those things a try? ; Patient: Yes I would try doctor definitely. ; Therapist: Great great. ; Therapist: The other thing I'd like you to consider is taking a course of iron tablets. ; Therapist: Oh I'm not into tablets why? ; Therapist: Okay this can be a really effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia and what it does is it supplements the amount of iron you're getting in your diet. ; Patient: So would that be short term? ; Therapist: Yes yes often people respond very well to those you can have some side effects. ; Patient: Oh dear. ; Therapist: Sometimes they can upset your tummy if you have them on you know on an empty stomach so what you do is you take them after a meal. ; Patient: Oh right yeah I do remember to do that yes yeah. ; Therapist: I think those two things adapting your diet and taking a course of iron tablets I think you might respond very well to those treatments. ; Therapist: Yes yeah I'll have a go at that doctor. ; Therapist: How do you feel about the information I've given you so far? ; Patient: That's fine yes I'll definitely try if it makes me feel any better it's worth it. ; Therapist: Yes excellent yeah excellent. ; Therapist: I've given you quite a lot of information about anemia today I've got a leaflet here about anemia which I thought you might like to take home and read in your own time. ; Patient: Oh thank you yes yeah oh yes yeah I'll read this doctor it's it's sometimes difficult to remember what what you tell so yes having a look at this at home would be really helpful. ; Patient: That's right yes that's right so just ; Therapist: to check that I've explained things to you correctly do you think you could just recap on the the two treatments that you're going to try? ; Patient: Well you said that the anemia is due to a lack of iron and I can get this from having some red meat I mean steak lunchops would that be? ; Patient: Yeah trim the fat off. ; Patient: Yeah and green vegetables and wholemeal bread and if I have these iron tablets and you know hopefully I'll feel better. ; Therapist: Thank you yes excellent so what I'd like you to do is come back in a couple of weeks and then we can see how you're doing. ; Patient: I'll do that yes. ; Therapist: Have you got any questions? ; Therapist: Are there any other tests I'll have to have? ; Therapist: I think at this stage when you come back to see me again we'll do another blood test and check on your hemoglobin level then if you haven't if it hasn't gone back into the normal range it might be then that we'd look at doing some other investigations but I don't want to worry about that at this stage I think let's see how you do with the dietary change in the iron tablet so we can discuss that next time. ; Therapist: Right thank you. ; Therapist: Yes is there anything else? ; Therapist: No I think that's it thank you. ; Therapist: Okay well good to see you and I'll see you again in a few weeks. ; Therapist: Okay thank you. ; Therapist: Bye. ; Patient: Bye.",

    "dialogue": "Patient: Come in. ; Therapist: Hi, Ms. ; Therapist: Jones. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: I'm Jane Crohn. ; Therapist: I'm a medical student with the University here. ; Patient: Nice to meet you. ; Therapist: I've been sent in by Dr. Smith as part of our training as a medical student to do an interview with you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And then I'll take that information back to Dr. Smith and then she will come back in and see you then after that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: How may I address you? ; Patient: Mrs. Jones is fine. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Patient: Thank you. ; Therapist: Is that okay with you today to talk? ; Patient: Yes, that would be fine. ; Therapist: Thank you. ; Therapist: I'm going to start out today by just talking a little bit with you about your chief complaint. ; Therapist: What brings you here today? ; Patient: Sure. ; Patient: My left elbow has actually been bugging me a lot. ; Patient: Every once in a while I've been getting a little bit of pain, extending my arm and going back to bending it. ; Patient: Really that's the primary reason I've come in. ; Patient: I've attempted to take a little bit of Tylenol to relieve the pain but it's not really seeming to help much. ; Therapist: Before we talk a little bit more about that, is there anything else that you want to talk with either me or Dr. Smith today? ; Patient: Not that I can think of, no. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: Tell me more about this pain. ; Patient: It's just kind of a throbbing pain. ; Patient: It'll act up kind of randomly throughout the day. ; Patient: It's not specific to the morning or evening or even in the middle of the day or night. ; Patient: It just kind of randomly acts up. ; Patient: I would say excessively like when I'm doing work, like after the dishes. ; Patient: It'll start to act up. ; Patient: If I lift one of my children up, it'll start to act up. ; Patient: Any sort of exertion is kind of where I've noticed a lot of the pain coming from. ; Therapist: Tell me when did it start for you? ; Patient: I would say maybe a week and a half to two weeks ago. ; Therapist: You describe the pain as throbbing. ; Therapist: Is there anything else about the pain in terms of the quality of the pain that you want to describe for me? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Just really throbbing. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Patient: It started about a week or two weeks ago. ; Therapist: Do you recall what you were doing at the time that it started? ; Patient: I've been helping my husband clean out the garage lately and we were lifting some boxes. ; Patient: I didn't notice it at the moment but later in the evening it started to act up. ; Therapist: I would like to hear a little bit about the severity of it on a pain scale of 1 to 10. ; Therapist: 10 being the worst pain you've ever had. ; Therapist: 1 or 0 being no pain. ; Therapist: How bad is this pain? ; Patient: I would measure it probably about a 6 or 7. ; Patient: It's become more of a nuisance than an actual physical pain. ; Therapist: And is it a 6 or 7 all the time? ; Patient: Whenever it starts to act up, yes. ; Therapist: And how often a day does that happen? ; Patient: I would say maybe 2 to 3 times per day. ; Therapist: Do you notice any pattern to that at all? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: And can you point exactly to where it is for me, the location of it exactly? ; Patient: It's kind of the area that just wraps around the actual elbow that is really bothering me. ; Therapist: And does that pain go up your arm or down your arm or anywhere else on your arm? ; Patient: No, it stays right in that area. ; Therapist: Is there anything else that goes on at the same time? ; Therapist: Any other symptoms that happen? ; Therapist: Anything else other than when the pain is happening there? ; Therapist: Anything else going on for you? ; Patient: Not that I've noticed, no. ; Therapist: Is there anything that makes it feel better? ; Patient: Nothing that completely gets rid of it. ; Patient: Tylenol will relieve it for a temporary period of time, but it hasn't gotten rid of it. ; Therapist: And how much Tylenol do you take? ; Patient: Whatever it says on the bottle, usually 1 to 2 tablets. ; Therapist: And is that regular strength or extra strength? ; Patient: Regular strength. ; Therapist: And you just take it across the counter, the normal directions on the bottle? ; Patient: Correct. ; Therapist: And does anything make it worse? ; Patient: Like I mentioned, any sort of exertion. ; Patient: Picking up a child, doing the dishes. ; Patient: Pretty much daily living activities. ; Therapist: So using it? ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Have you seen anybody else for this complaint? ; Patient: No. ; Therapist: What else have you tried other than the Tylenol and anything else other than Tylenol? ; Patient: I've attempted to use a heating pad on it and I've also attempted ice. ; Patient: Neither were successful. ; Therapist: It sounds you've talked a little bit about how it's impacted you to be able to work in the garage, or do the dishes, or lift your child. ; Therapist: Is there other impact on your life? ; Patient: Like I mentioned, it's more of a nuisance. ; Patient: There will be times in the middle of the night that it will start to act up. ; Patient: If I get up to go to the bathroom, I'll notice pain in my elbow. ; Therapist: Does it wake you at night? ; Patient: It doesn't, but if I wake up in the middle of the night, it will trouble me and fall back asleep. ; Therapist: What do you think it is? ; Patient: I'm not quite sure. ; Patient: My best guess is maybe some sort of pulled muscle or something. ; Patient: But honestly, I don't know. ; Therapist: Alright. ; Therapist: What I'd like to do now is just kind of go through all the things that you've told me and summarized for you. ; Therapist: This is information that I want to take back, but I want to make sure that I have it all correct. ; Therapist: So if I've forgotten something or I've gotten something incorrect, please help me. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You came to the clinic today for a complaint of left elbow pain. ; Therapist: And it's pain that you mostly noticed when you were bending it or using it in some capacity. ; Therapist: It's a throbbing pain that happens randomly, but it does happen two to three times during the day. ; Therapist: What you notice about it is if you exert or you extend or flex your elbow at all, that's when it seems to be at its worst. ; Therapist: It's gone on for about a week, maybe to two weeks when you think back on it. ; Therapist: And it started out when you were helping your husband clean the garage and you were lifting lots of boxes. ; Therapist: It's about a six to seven on a pain scale. ; Therapist: And you describe it over and over as being a nuisance, which tells me that it's getting kind of in the way of doing some things that you want to. ; Therapist: You report that it happens probably two to three times a day and that the pain wraps around the joint completely. ; Therapist: You've taken some Tylenol for it across the counter. ; Therapist: You've taken that several times a day, not without much relief. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: That it hasn't helped much. ; Therapist: You've tried a heating pad. ; Therapist: You've tried some ice. ; Therapist: That hasn't really helped either too much. ; Therapist: It sounds like, again, you kept referring to it as a nuisance, that it's just kind of getting in the way of your daily activities. ; Therapist: It doesn't necessarily keep you up at night, but you do notice it at night when you wake up that it's still going on for you. ; Therapist: So sleep doesn't seem to help much. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And that what you mostly think this could be is a pulled muscle of some type. ; Therapist: Is there anything I've forgotten or that you wanted to tell me about this? ; Patient: Not that I can think of, no. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Thank you for telling me about your chief concern. ; Therapist: I'm going to take it back to Dr. Smith. ; Patient: Thank you very much.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hello Carl, how you doing today? ; Patient: I'm good, how are you? ; Therapist: I'm doing well, thanks for asking. ; Therapist: Last week you were talking in therapy. ; Patient: Yeah, I mean, and I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week, but Jill, I was telling you about Jill, my coworker, and she was kind of bothering me the past couple of weeks, but really this past week was like the worst, right? ; Patient: So she's not doing her paperwork, and the thing is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports. ; Patient: So if she doesn't have hers, I can't do mine, and then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do theirs, and it's a mess, the whole thing's a mess. ; Patient: And it's annoying me. ; Therapist: So her work slow down, or not being efficient work, is affecting your work productivity. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, it definitely is. ; Patient: And it's one of those things that like, you know, it gives me a bad evaluation. ; Patient: If I'm not handing my stuff in in time, then it reflects negatively on me, you know, and it's all kind of, she's the first level, you know, and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time. ; Patient: So if she doesn't, then I don't, then the next person does, and so forth. ; Therapist: And it makes it seem like you're not doing your job. ; Patient: Right, yeah, and my boss doesn't like it, my boss's boss doesn't like it, and so forth, you know? ; Patient: And I try to explain to them, you know, she's the problem, but it doesn't always, I don't always have the time to go up and tell them, like, here's what's happening, or it just somehow doesn't come out. ; Therapist: You don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation. ; Patient: Yeah, and that's pretty annoying too, because, you know, it's one thing if people get mad at me, but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job like I'm supposed to. ; Patient: But it's another thing for them to get mad at me not realizing it's not my fault, you know? ; Therapist: You have an explanation for why the work's not getting done. ; Patient: Yeah, I do, I do, that's the thing. ; Patient: But I can't always get it out, you know, I can't always tell the person that has the complaint about it. ; Patient: And yeah, I mean, I've tried talking to my boss, and I've tried talking to other people too, you know, but it really hasn't gotten anywhere. ; Therapist: So you're feeling stuck with this whole thing. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah I am, and I mean, I talked to Jill a little bit about it too, you know, and I tried to ask, I tried kind of genuinely reminding her, you know, like, such and such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock. ; Patient: I didn't want to be real abrasive, you know, but I tried to remind her. ; Therapist: It was a polite approach. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, and it didn't really seem to work because it still happened, you know. ; Therapist: Your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you want it. ; Patient: No, no it really hasn't, and that's just, I feel like I've tried everything that I could try, you know? ; Patient: And even like, I came home and I was talking to a friend about it, and I was trying to think of other solutions, right? ; Patient: You know, I was trying to think like, what else I could do, what else I could say, who else I could talk to, things like that, you know? ; Patient: And I mean, my friend, you know, he was listening and stuff, and had some good suggestions, but he didn't know what to do either, like, because he doesn't know the way the company works, you know? ; Patient: So like, I got nothing. ; Therapist: You're not getting the help you need for this. ; Patient: Yeah, not at all. ; Patient: I'm feeling pretty lost with it, and I wish it was just like a clear way to do things, like, this is what you should do now. ; Patient: And I don't see anything. ; Therapist: Some sort of clear plan. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: But yeah, I don't see a way to go about it. ; Patient: I mean, I've, so I've, okay, so this is the way I laid it out in my mind. ; Patient: I tried talking to the people above me. ; Patient: Didn't work out the way I thought it would. ; Patient: I tried talking to the people below me, so to speak, just lower on the, before me in the process. ; Patient: That's what I mean. ; Patient: And that didn't work out, which is just Jill, and I talked to her, and that didn't work. ; Patient: So like, there's nowhere else I could turn. ; Therapist: The options are exhausted. ; Patient: Yeah, that's what it seems like to me. ; Therapist: And this is frustrating for you. ; Patient: Yeah, it is. ; Patient: And I've been trying to rack my brain, you know, like, what else could I do? ; Patient: You know? ; Patient: Like, maybe if I could, maybe if there was like a committee or something that I could go to, you know, I'd be like, well, this person's not doing what they're supposed to be doing. ; Patient: But there's not, there's no committee like that. ; Patient: Or even if there was like a person, you know, like a resolution person or whatever, but there's nobody like that. ; Therapist: There's no other avenue. ; Patient: That's what it seems like to me. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And that's, I mean, that's, and you know, as I'm even trying to think, like, I don't know, should I write a letter to somebody maybe? ; Patient: But I don't even know who or what. ; Therapist: You thought about a letter, but who would you send it to? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Or like, just something else that I can do instead of going to this person, going to that person, that didn't work. ; Patient: Could I call somebody? ; Patient: Is there anybody else in the company that, you know, might handle stuff like that? ; Patient: But I mean, there's HR people, but that's, I can't really see where they could come in. ; Patient: I don't know how human resources could deal with something like that. ; Therapist: You don't feel them as a potential solution? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: Yeah, no, I don't. ; Patient: I wonder maybe if there's like a, but there's, I mean, I'm thinking now that there's gotta be something or somebody or somewhere that I could put in like, almost like a complaint or something, like something's out of my hands and I don't know what to do about it. ; Patient: Like, there's gotta be something. ; Patient: And now that I'm saying this, I'm thinking that there's gotta be. ; Therapist: Some other resource you haven't tried yet. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah. ; Patient: And I mean, now I'm trying to think back to my training, you know, initially. ; Patient: You know, maybe there's, you know what, I think now that I'm thinking a little bit harder about it, a little bit differently about it, I'm thinking that there's like a, man, I forget what they call it now, but maybe like a complaint. ; Patient: It's not the right word, but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something. ; Patient: And I think, if I remember correctly, those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting, which we have like every other week. ; Therapist: They're discussed at this regular meeting. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: And I'm thinking now, I mean, nobody really uses it, but I'm thinking like maybe that's an avenue that I can use, you know, like maybe that'll get brought up and maybe that's something that might actually work. ; Therapist: This could be another option for you. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, it could be. ; Patient: And then if it does work, it'll get brought, rather if they do read it, it'll get brought up at the staff meeting where everybody's at. ; Patient: My boss, my boss's boss, Jill, everybody's there. ; Patient: And maybe that's a way for it to come to everybody's attention that deadlines being missed affect other people in ways that you don't really know about. ; Therapist: So everyone will hear your complaint and maybe react in a way that would help you. ; Patient: Maybe, yeah. ; Patient: I think that's, I mean, that's gotta be the way to do it. ; Patient: And maybe that's the best way. ; Patient: I really think, yeah, I mean, after saying all that and after going through that, I really think that that's probably the best way to do it. ; Patient: And if it doesn't, then I guess I can find another way, but I really think that's the best way to do it. ; Therapist: You feel as though you've found an option here. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, I do. ; Patient: And even if that doesn't work, then it'll be brought up and maybe it'll allow me to talk to my boss further about it and maybe they'll understand really where I'm coming from. ; Patient: But this will at least be a start to something, you know, to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff, you know. ; Therapist: You are frustrated with all this. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: But maybe, maybe after I do that, you know, put in the complaint or suggestion, maybe I won't be as frustrated. ; Patient: I mean, I'm feeling a little bit less frustrated now, even thinking that there is another option, you know. ; Therapist: It feels better now as you're contemplating another potential avenue here. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, it does. ; Therapist: Well, this might be a good place to wrap this session up. ; Therapist: That feels like the right move for you. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And we'll schedule, so I see you next week and we can pick up from there. ; Patient: Sounds good. ; Patient: All right, cool. ; Therapist: Thanks, Carl. ; Patient: Thank you.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: How are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm okay. ; Therapist: What's been going on? ; Patient: Well, last time I started to tell you a little bit about one of my friends, my best friend ; Patient: actually, she had this issue. ; Patient: So what happened was she went to a bathroom at our local library and she found a video camera when she was going to the bathroom. ; Therapist: In the bathroom? ; Patient: Yeah, she actually, yeah. ; Patient: And she turned it into the police and I guess because she carried it or she had found it, her handprints were on it and they weren't able to detect who actually did it. ; Patient: They weren't able to catch the person. ; Therapist: Oh, they didn't catch the person? ; Patient: No. ; Patient: So since then I've been on really just high alert. ; Patient: I'm worried that that could happen to me, to my kids. ; Patient: I'm just really worried because they didn't catch the guy that him or someone like him could be out there. ; Therapist: So he's still out in the community. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So how is it affecting your daily life? ; Therapist: Can you tell me kind of what you've been feeling? ; Patient: A lot of anxiety, just not knowing maybe what if someone were to videotape me like that. ; Patient: I've been very aware, shall I say, of cameras. ; Therapist: Okay, so anxious and aware. ; Patient: Right, like I know you have one in your office and people on their cell phone cameras. ; Therapist: Others? ; Patient: Just all the possibilities that I could be recorded. ; Patient: I've just been very aware of them, which makes me not want to go anywhere. ; Patient: So I've been having arguments with my husband a lot because he wants to go out to restaurants and I don't want to go because there could be cameras in the bathrooms. ; Patient: And how I dress also, as you can see, I'm kind of dressed more conservatively because I remember hearing once about cameras that people use on shoes that could be used in a creepy way. ; Patient: And so I can't, you know, it's now almost summertime, I can't dress in skirts or be comfortable because I'm dressing like that. ; Therapist: Right, so you covered a lot of ground there. ; Therapist: So you have the feeling of being worried, nervous, that it's going to happen to you. ; Therapist: But you've also had to kind of change your routine or you have to change your routine to feel safer. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Has that helped? ; Therapist: Has changing the way you dress or changing where you go and when you go, has that helped reduce the anxiety? ; Patient: Not really. ; Therapist: No? ; Patient: I would say it's really, that's why I wanted to come in. ; Patient: It's really starting to affect my life. ; Therapist: You mentioned specifically your husband. ; Therapist: Like what's been going on there? ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: He just wants to go places with our kids, like go out to eat and I don't really want to go anywhere because, you know, cameras are everywhere nowadays. ; Therapist: They are? ; Patient: And I just kind of worry like public bathrooms, could they be there? ; Patient: Could someone be, you know, sometimes baby monitors are hooked to phones and people can hack into that. ; Patient: Laptop cameras. ; Patient: So even in my own house, I've just been really nervous. ; Patient: So I feel like I'm not really getting relief from that anxiety. ; Therapist: Have you taken any precautions because of this persistent worry? ; Patient: I mean, I've read... ; Therapist: Other than what you already mentioned. ; Therapist: With the camera specifically, I mean. ; Patient: I've, you know, when I go into bathrooms, I've been looking for cameras to make sure they weren't there before. ; Patient: You know, me and my children have used the bathroom. ; Patient: I have tried, I've read online that you can turn, how to turn off the cameras on your phone and that you can close your laptop and that way the camera will face down. ; Patient: So, and the same thing on a smart TV, so it doesn't recognize your face. ; Patient: I've tried to turn things off that don't need to be on as far as people being able to access my own information. ; Therapist: And that seems reasonable. ; Therapist: So you've taken reasonable precautions to try to avoid being video recorded against ; Therapist: your will. ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: But still you have this feeling of worry, anxiety and your schedule is being interfered with. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So you'd like to cope more effectively with your feelings, reduce this anxiety. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So, when you enter into a public bathroom, and we talked about automatic thoughts before. ; Therapist: Yes. ; Patient: Those thoughts just kind of pop into our head and they connect to feelings that can be unpleasant. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: Like anxiety and worry. ; Therapist: So, when you walk into a public restroom, what's the first thing that goes through your mind? ; Patient: That there might be a video camera that I don't see, that's maybe like with my friend it was big enough, but I might not catch it and that someone's going to use that in a vulnerable way. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, when you walk in, you're wondering if there's a camera there. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: And when that automatic thought occurs, what follows that in terms of a feeling or a behavior? ; Patient: Usually, I'll try and find the camera, but it's usually anxiety, fear, my heart rate starts going up, I start getting really anxious. ; Patient: And then, you know, I try and either rush to use the bathroom if I really have to go, or a lot of times if I don't, I'll just leave. ; Patient: Sometimes I try and use the bathroom at home so I don't have to go out. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So, your behavior is looking for the camera or sometimes just leaving without using the restroom. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And your feeling is that anxiety worry that we've been talking about. ; Patient: Yes. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, really if we think about, we talked before about core beliefs, intermediate beliefs, and I'm wondering if the intermediate belief isn't I'm vulnerable or this, you know, more specifically maybe, and that's more of a core belief, more specifically I'm vulnerable in this area, like with this guy on the loose that, you know, committed that crime. ; Therapist: And then, you know, that's combining with situations that you encounter and that's where you're getting those automatic thoughts. ; Therapist: Does that sort of make sense? ; Patient: Exactly. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Therapist: So, you remember what, in terms of cognitive therapy, you like to apply what we call the adaptive response or self-talk. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So, it's that thought that you interject at that moment you realize you're having an automatic thought that's going to lead to, in this case, anxiety and worry and behaviors that, well, looking for the camera isn't maybe an unuseful behavior, but leaving, you know, that could certainly be an unuseful behavior. ; Therapist: So, in terms of that self-talk, let's work to develop a self-talk response. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So, there's something you could tell yourself to that initial, you know, I wonder if there's a camera in this bathroom. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: What do you think you could tell yourself that would get in between that thought and the feelings you're having? ; Patient: I could say if when I walk in the bathroom. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Patient: Maybe I could say, you know, while there could be a chance that there's a camera in this bathroom, the chance of it happening is not very likely. ; Patient: And, you know, I'm going to take steps to keep myself safe so that I won't be in a vulnerable position, such as looking for the cameras. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: So, you have a low probability of it happening, and you're taking useful behaviors to minimize your risk even further. ; Therapist: Right. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So, that's a good automatic thought. ; Therapist: I think, or a good adaptive response for the automatic thought, rather. ; Therapist: Why don't you try that one out, right, the next time you have that automatic thought? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Try out that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And, you know, that's logical. ; Therapist: I mean, it's unlikely to happen. ; Therapist: Of course, there's a chance, right? ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And we acknowledge that in the self-talk. ; Therapist: There's a chance that it could happen, but there's precautions you can take that's a low chance. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Sometimes, as well, so keep that automatic thought kind of, you know, we'll review it at the end. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right, before you leave today. ; Therapist: We'll write these down. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: But that's one adaptive response, rather, that I want to write down for you. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: I also want to talk about, like, the worst case scenario, because right now you have the anxiety and the worry about an event that, while it's unlikely it could happen, it could happen. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: And I'm wondering how you think you would react if the worst did happen, if you used the restroom and you found out from law enforcement or by finding a camera that an offender had been, you know, watching you, right, on a recording. ; Therapist: I think you would react to that. ; Patient: I mean, I think I would be really upset. ; Patient: I think I would feel vulnerable probably for a while and be hesitant. ; Patient: But, I mean, I think ultimately I would be okay. ; Patient: My friend, this happened a while ago, she's starting to get over it and get back to her usual routine, although she's still hesitant. ; Patient: So I think I would be okay eventually, although I'd be really upset that it happened. ; Therapist: And it would make sense to feel upset, right? ; Therapist: That would be upsetting for anybody. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: But, as you noted, that would probably be relatively temporary. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: Distressed, right? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: While acute, and certainly, you know, you wouldn't be happy about it and shouldn't be happy about it. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: It would probably go away. ; Therapist: You'd probably learn to adapt. ; Therapist: How long have you been in this state of anxiety and worry? ; Patient: Probably it happened like two months ago. ; Therapist: Two months. ; Therapist: And how many days in the average week are you affected by these feelings? ; Patient: Usually every day. ; Therapist: Every day. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So if we can compare it, right, we have the chances of being recorded, right, illegally. ; Therapist: That's a low probability event. ; Therapist: It could happen, probably not likely. ; Therapist: The anxiety and the worry that you're having, that's a high probability event because you're suffering from it every day. ; Patient: Yeah, that's true. ; Patient: I never thought about it that way. ; Therapist: So there's a point at which maybe you reach and you say, I'd rather take the risk, I'd rather deal with the potential consequence of an unlikely event of being recorded and face that if it happens than be in the state of anxiety and worry. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: Because right now I'm suffering every day. ; Therapist: Right, now you're suffering, right. ; Patient: Right. ; Therapist: So if you could adaptively respond effectively, you're still going to have that risk of being recorded, but you know you could survive that event if it happened. ; Patient: Right, yeah, I think I could. ; Therapist: And you're taking reasonable cautions and all the things we talked about. ; Therapist: So as you think about this in a more general sense, is there an adaptive response you could apply to that on-the-act thought of I need to be worried about this or whatever that thought looks like. ; Therapist: Sometimes the thought's an image, right, so maybe an image of being recorded. ; Therapist: But whatever that kind of general series of automatic thoughts are that are getting you anxious and worried before you even get out of the house, what adaptive response could you apply there? ; Patient: Maybe, you know, like I said, I'm worried about all the cameras. ; Patient: Maybe I could say, you know, I understand there's some cameras that, you know, are used for good purposes like security. ; Therapist: Probably most are. ; Patient: Right. ; Patient: And the chances of being recorded illegally are not likely. ; Patient: And I'm taking precautions to, you know, go to the right places, the good areas. ; Patient: So it's not likely to happen overall. ; Patient: And me going outside the house is worth the risk, you know, the minimal risk that it would happen. ; Patient: And if it did happen, I could survive. ; Therapist: That's good. ; Therapist: That’s a good adaptive response. ; Therapist: And that's kind of a few adaptive responses. ; Therapist: But that's good. ; Therapist: And you can apply them and we'll kind of break them down. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Like I said before you leave today, we'll break those down. ; Therapist: So you can hammer them down as you go out. ; Therapist: And I think it's important because, you know, automatic thoughts tend to spring on us quickly. ; Therapist: It's important to rehearse these adaptive responses so we're ready to go. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And kind of, you know, we're being, we're preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive response. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And in order to be prepared, you have to know what it is. ; Therapist: So it's good to have it written down and kind of more or less commit to memory. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that kind of make sense? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So before you leave today, I'll take care of that. ; Therapist: And I want you to use those adaptive responses for this week. ; Therapist: I'll see you next week. ; Therapist: And record what the outcome was every time you're able to apply that response. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And that includes what you felt and what you actually did. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right. ; Therapist: And of course as you mentioned any, you know, physiological reactions like your heart racing or anything like that. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: So that's, really that's a behavior. ; Therapist: But note both physiological behaviors and other behaviors. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: You know, once you're consciously controlling and then any feelings. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we'll go through them, we'll go through each time you use it, one by one behavior there are. ; Therapist: And kind of see if we need to adjust the adaptive response and see how well it's working. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Does that sound like the plan? ; Patient: Yeah, I think that would be really helpful. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: So we'll go from there and I appreciate you coming in today. ; Patient: Thank you very much. ; Therapist: Thanks, guys. ; Therapist: Bye.",

    "dialogue": "Therapist: Hi, how are you doing today? ; Patient: I'm okay. ; Patient: How are you, Dr. Grande? ; Therapist: Not bad. ; Therapist: Thanks for asking. ; Therapist: What's been going on? ; Patient: There's not really a lot of change on the drug front. ; Patient: You know, the Adderall, I'm really struggling. ; Therapist: Still struggling with the Adderall? ; Patient: I'm not sure what to do because I know that, I mean, I'm having such a hard time with it, but when I don't have it, I'm just not functioning. ; Patient: I'm not able to get as much accomplished. ; Therapist: Alright, so, go ahead. ; Patient: Well, it's like it's always there too. ; Therapist: It's always available to you. ; Patient: It's always available, yeah, or so much of the time. ; Therapist: Alright, so you're having some mixed feelings about it though, I'm sensing. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, like I know I want to stop, I think. ; Therapist: You think you want to stop? ; Patient: Yeah, no, I do. ; Therapist: You do? ; Patient: Oh my God, see, I feel crazy, but I know it would be good if I didn't have it in my life. ; Therapist: But at the same time, it is in your life. ; Patient: And I don't know how to get out of that. ; Patient: I mean, the one thing, if I didn't live with my roommate, that would be one thing. ; Patient: I wouldn't be in the apartment all the time. ; Therapist: So, you find you have easier access to the Adderall when you're in the house or apartment with your roommate? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, if you physically weren't there, like with your roommate in that apartment? ; Patient: Yeah, like if I was, oh my God, living at home with my parents again, or even living with somebody else, I guess. ; Patient: Oh my God, to move! ; Patient: What a hassle, but that's, I mean, that's the problem. ; Patient: It's just there. ; Patient: It's accessible. ; Therapist: So, you're kind of, it sounds like you're recognizing that maybe you don't have the willpower to stop taking the drug when it's right there in front of you. ; Patient: Maybe you're right. ; Patient: That's good. ; Patient: Because before I didn't really want to stop. ; Patient: And sometimes I want to stop. ; Patient: My mind will go back and forth. ; Patient: But for the most part, I would like to be without it. ; Patient: I really don't want to deal with this anymore. ; Therapist: So, mostly, so there's still some feelings where you want to use it, but mostly you would like to stop. ; Patient: Well, it makes it so easy to get stuff done. ; Patient: I mean, I just take a couple and boom, boom, boom. ; Patient: I mean. ; Therapist: So, there's some advantages for you. ; Patient: Yeah, definitely. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Patient: And I'm so used to it, too. ; Patient: It's just comfortable. ; Therapist: It's comfortable and it allows you to be productive. ; Therapist: Are there any downsides to it? ; Patient: Well, yeah. ; Patient: When I don't have it, the crash, it's like a really bad crash. ; Patient: I'm not productive. ; Patient: You know, it's, and it's gotten worse than it used to be. ; Therapist: So, it's painful. ; Patient: Like, I need it. ; Patient: It's painful. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Patient: Definitely. ; Patient: It feels like a trap. ; Patient: And I want out. ; Therapist: And one of the ideas you were having was, it sounded like potentially, was moving out. ; Therapist: Moving out of the apartment. ; Therapist: Because then you wouldn't have access to the, you wouldn't have access to the Adderall anymore. ; Therapist: Or it would be harder to get. ; Patient: Oh my God. ; Patient: Like, sometimes it's really weird. ; Patient: Sometimes it feels like that's a good idea and then sometimes I'm like, no, no. ; Patient: I don't want to be, you know, kind of cut off from it. ; Patient: But, I think I'm ready. ; Therapist: You think you're ready for that? ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that moving out, you really see is what you would need to do. ; Therapist: Because stopping while living there is too difficult. ; Patient: Oh my God. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, I think you're right. ; Therapist: I remember before you've tried to stop while living there a few times, right? ; Therapist: Or the last few months. ; Therapist: And with your roommate having it, with your roommate being the one that gives it to you, it just appears the temptation is so great for you. ; Patient: Yeah, she really doesn't get it. ; Patient: She doesn't understand, like, what a problem this is for me. ; Patient: She's definitely not supporting me or anything like that. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: God, maybe it would be better. ; Therapist: Well, are there any disadvantages to living with your parents? ; Patient: Living with my parents at my age, it just feels like a little bit humiliating, a lot humiliating. ; Therapist: Okay, so humiliation would be one? ; Patient: Yeah, and just this feeling of failure, embarrassment. ; Patient: And then my mom just is in my business, you know. ; Therapist: So there's some clear disadvantages to moving into parents. ; Therapist: Any advantages other than the obvious, it would sever you from the adderall? ; Patient: My mom would do my laundry, fully stocked fridge. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Patient: Yeah, my dad will fill my gas tank up. ; Therapist: Are these things that happened before when you used to live there? ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, not so bad. ; Therapist: So there's some disadvantages to this plan, but there's some advantages and there's a key advantage of being cut off from the adderall. ; Patient: Yeah, and it wouldn't necessarily have to be the rest of my life either. ; Therapist: Hmm. ; Patient: Just for now, just to get me out of that apartment with the drug, right? ; Therapist: That would separate you from the drug and you could potentially move out later on. ; Patient: Oh my God, do I want to? ; Patient: I mean, that's just it. ; Patient: It sounds really good until I really think about it. ; Therapist: So when you really think about it, what comes to mind? ; Patient: Oh, like I start to shake, like that feeling of, you know, when you really want something, you really want something and you can't get to it. ; Patient: And it's just that desperation that, and like right now, I know that I'm living there, it could be my choice. ; Patient: I could take it or I could not take it, you know, but at least when I want it, it's there. ; Patient: If I move out, I'm like making that decision for myself. ; Therapist: That's right, you would be. ; Patient: I don't know. ; Therapist: Is this tough? ; Therapist: Well, before it seemed like you were really more on the side of making this change than not. ; Therapist: But clearly there's still some things you want to consider. ; Patient: No, you know, you're right though. ; Patient: I want out. ; Patient: And it's not really a choice when I'm there. ; Patient: Like I say I have the choice, yes or no, but the choice is always yes. ; Therapist: You always end up using the Adderall. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, let me make sure I understand the situation overall. ; Therapist: You live with your roommate, she has Adderall, when she makes it available to you, you use it. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: You've tried to stop that behavior, but that's just not working for you. ; Patient: Yeah, yeah, that's so clear. ; Patient: And I don't want to be using it. ; Therapist: You don't want to be using it, but yet you are, especially because the proximity. ; Therapist: Because you're right there and she has it and it's just tough for you to stop that behavior. ; Therapist: There's another possible decision, which is moving back home, which has some disadvantages and advantages. ; Patient: Yeah, that's true. ; Patient: God, it would be nice having that fully stocked fridge. ; Therapist: So, there's an upside to it that would be beyond just not using the drug, which in itself would be a big victory for you. ; Patient: Yeah, and my mom would be there to talk to, yeah. ; Therapist: So, let's do this. ; Therapist: It seems like that's the direction you're moving, right? ; Patient: Okay, yeah. ; Therapist: No pun intended with the word moving, but you're thinking that might be a better way to go. ; Patient: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, for the next session, let's plan out, and this wouldn't necessarily be doing anything, let's plan out the steps that you'd have to put in place to move back home. ; Therapist: Talking to your parents, whatever financial arrangement you have with your roommate, getting all your stuff out, the logistics of moving, let's just go through the steps. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And try to get a firm plan together. ; Therapist: And of course you can always reevaluate and change your mind. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: Right, but all we're doing at this point is just planning and seeing how it would look. ; Patient: This is kind of exciting. ; Therapist: Is it exciting? ; Patient: Yeah, it definitely is. ; Patient: I can do that. ; Therapist: Good. ; Therapist: So, I will see you next week. ; Patient: Okay. ; Therapist: And we'll pick up right where we left off, and we'll start with the planning, and we'll see what happens with that. ; Patient: Cool. ; Patient: All right. ; Therapist: All right. ; Therapist: Thanks, Anne. ; Patient: Sure.",
